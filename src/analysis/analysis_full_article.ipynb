       "[\"Introduction\\nBackground\\nStroke is a highly prevalent public health concern, and\\nthe leading cause of death and disability among adults in\\ndeveloped countries [1, 2]. In the USA alone, stroke has\\nan annual incidence of approximately 795,000, and is as-\\nsociated with an estimated 34 billion dollar cost from\\nhealth care services, medications, and missed days of\\nwork [1]. A stroke is often a devastating life-altering\\nevent for both patients and their family/friend caregivers\\n[3–5]. Stroke occurs without warning and may result\\nnot only in death or profound disability but also sub-\\nstantial emotional trauma for both patients and care-\\ngivers [5, 6]. Although advances in endovascular and\\nneurocritical care approaches to stroke treatment and\\nrecovery have substantially increase the number of survi-\\nvors, there remains a need to develop treatments to ad-\\ndress the emotional sequelae associated with the stroke\\nand subsequent hospitalization for both patients and\\ntheir informal caregivers. Rates of clinically significant\\nsymptoms of depression and anxiety (30–72% patients;\\n55–68% caregivers), as well as post-traumatic stress\\n(PTS; 29.6% patients; 20% caregivers) are high [7–16] at\\nhospitalization for an acute brain injury (including a\\nstroke) and predictive of chronic emotional distress at 3-\\nand 6-months later for both patient and caregiver [8–\\n10]. However, there are no evidence-based psychosocial\\ninterventions focused on prevention of chronic emo-\\ntional distress in this population.\\nEmerging cross-sectional and prospective research, in-\\ncluding our own, has shown that patient and caregiver\\npsychosocial factors influence each other and shape each\\nperson’s recovery trajectory after a brain injury (such as\\na stroke), including outcomes of PTS, anxiety, and de-\\npression [17–19]. Poor patient mental health is not only\\ndirectly associated with poor physical recovery but also\\ntranslates in greater caregiving burden, which negatively\\nimpacts caregivers’ mental health [20]. In turn, care-\\ngivers’ poorer mental health lowers the quality of care to\\nthe patients [20, 21], which impacts patients' physical\\nand mental health [22, 23]. This interdependence be-\\ntween patient and caregiver factors requires consider-\\nation of the dyad (e.g., pair of patient and caregiver) in\\norder to fully capture an individual’s level of mental\\nhealth risk following a stroke.\\nDyadic interventions that account for the interdepend-\\nence between patient and caregiver factors across the re-\\ncovery trajectory may be the most effective and efficient\\nway to address emotional distress in this high-risk popu-\\nlation. This contention is supported by two recent sys-\\ntematic reviews from the American Heart Association\\n[24, 25] which included available psychosocial interven-\\ntions for stroke patients and caregivers. These reviews\\nhighlighted substantial limitations of current interven-\\ntions for stroke patient and/or caregivers, such as an em-\\nphasis on treatment rather than on prevention of\\nemotional distress, a focus on improving either patient\\nor caregiver factors without accounting for their inter-\\ndependence, and a lack of modular and tailored inter-\\nventions to account for the heterogeneity of stroke\\npatients' and caregivers' unique challenges and concerns.\\nThese systematic reviews recommended the develop-\\nment of dyadic (i.e., both patient and caregiver together)\\ninterventions that are tailored to the unique needs of\\nBannon et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies (2020) 6:75\\nPage 2 of 16\\nheterogeneous stroke patients and caregivers and aimed\\nat preventing chronic emotional distress in both mem-\\nbers of the dyad. Dyadic interventions are also more eco-\\nnomical both in terms of interventionist time, as well as\\noverall treatment cost [26–29].\\nIn line with these recommendations, we used a mixed-\\nmethods approach to develop Recovering\\nTogether\\n(RT)—the first dyadic intervention aimed at preventing\\nchronic emotional distress in at-risk stroke dyads. First,\\nwe conducted cross-sectional and prospective studies\\nwith\\npatients\\nand\\ntheir\\nprimary\\ncaregivers\\nat\\nhospitalization in a Neuroscience Intensive Care Unit\\n(Neuro-ICU) and identified key modifiable intervention\\ntargets associated with emotional distress (e.g., mindful-\\nness, coping, interpersonal bond, and self-efficacy) [7–\\n10, 16]. Next, we conducted 24 qualitative interviews\\nwith stroke dyads followed by three focus groups with\\nnurses [15] to determine dyads’ challenges associated\\nwith the stroke and subsequent hospitalization, percep-\\ntions of the proposed intervention targets, ways to best\\nteach the proposed resiliency skills, interest in the inter-\\nvention, and best modality for intervention delivery. We\\nsubsequently treated one stroke dyad with Recovering\\nTogether [30] and made refinements from lessons\\nlearned.\\nIn the present study, we report on a feasibility ran-\\ndomized control trial (RCT) of RT versus a minimally\\nenhanced usual care (MEUC) control group, which\\nfollowed recommendations for rigorous feasibility testing\\n[31, 32]. The study had two primary aims. First, we mea-\\nsured feasibility and acceptability markers (primary out-\\ncomes), including (1) ability to recruit dyads, (2) ability\\nto retain dyads, (3) acceptability of randomization, (4)\\ncredibility, and (5) satisfaction. Second, we assessed the\\nsignals of within group improvement (baseline to post-\\ntest to 3 months follow-up) in emotional distress (e.g.,\\nsymptoms of depression, anxiety and PTS) and interven-\\ntion targets (mindfulness, coping, interpersonal bond,\\nand self-efficacy) for patients and caregivers (secondary\\noutcomes) randomized to RT and for those randomized\\nto MEUC.\\nMethods\\nDesign\\nThe current feasibility study was part of a sequential\\nframework for intervention development [33]. Our larger\\ngoal was to prepare for a future hybrid efficacy-\\neffectiveness study testing RT’s effect in order to scale,\\nimplement, and disseminate this intervention to other\\nNeuro-ICUs in diverse geographical regions across the\\nUSA and beyond. This feasibility RCT was conducted in\\nthe Neuro-ICU at a major urban medical teaching hos-\\npital. We compared the novel RT intervention to a\\nMEUC\\ncondition\\n(educational\\npamphlet).\\nSimple\\nrandomization was performed using a random number\\ngenerator to maintain balance between the groups dur-\\ning random assignment. Participants were not blinded to\\nintervention versus the control. Participants completed\\nquestionnaires in person (i.e., during inpatient admis-\\nsion, with staff assistance, as needed) at baseline and ei-\\nther electronically through a link emailed directly to\\npatients and caregivers via the secure web-based data\\ncollection platform REDCap [34] or over the phone, at\\npost-test [~ 6 weeks after baseline] and 3-month follow-\\nup. The trial was designed to address specific objectives\\nrelating to study design and methodology for the subse-\\nquent hybrid efficacy-effectiveness trial and was not de-\\nsigned to determine efficacy [31, 32]. There were no\\nimportant changes to methods (e.g., eligibility criteria)\\nafter the trial commenced. Our Institutional Review\\nBoard approved all study procedures prior to study\\ninception.\\nRecovering Together intervention\\nRecovering Together (RT) is a six-session, seven-module\\n(two universal and five specific), skills-based dyadic\\nintervention targeting the prevention of chronic emo-\\ntional distress in patients and their informal caregivers.\\nRT is informed by elements of traditional cognitive be-\\nhavioral therapy (CBT; e.g., cognitive restructuring/reap-\\npraisals, adaptive thinking), dialectical behavior therapy\\n(DBT; e.g., mindfulness, dialectics, distress tolerance),\\nand principles from trauma-informed care (e.g., impact\\nof the illness/injury, understanding triggers, role and\\nidentity changes, meaning making), to address unique\\nneeds experienced by each dyads [15]. The intervention\\ndirectly targets self-efficacy, mindfulness, coping skills,\\nand intimate bonds within dyads, consistent with our\\nprior quantitative and qualitative research [7, 9, 10, 13,\\n15, 16]. The first two sessions are delivered to all dyads,\\nare conducted with both the patient and caregiver at\\nbedside, and teach the core skills of mindfulness, dialec-\\ntics, diaphragmatic breathing, and self-care. The follow-\\ning four sessions take place after the patient’s discharge\\nvia a secure video platform (i.e., Vidyo software). The\\npatient and caregiver collaborate with the clinician to\\nidentify four out of the five available modules that best\\nalign with the dyad’s presentation and needs. These ses-\\nsions build upon and rehearse skills learned in the first\\ntwo sessions, and teach additional skills and topics se-\\nlected by dyads [15]. All sessions are approximately 20–\\n30 min and modules can be delivered in any order\\ndeemed appropriate/relevant. Table 1 provides session\\ntitles and a description of the treatment components.\\nMinimally enhanced usual care control\\nDyads assigned to the minimally enhanced usual care\\n(MEUC) condition received a three page informational\\nBannon et al.

Caregiver-specific in-\\nformation included self-care strategies (e.g., finding\\ntimes to take breaks from caregiving, keeping balance by\\neating healthy, exercising, and resting, etc.), ways of\\nseeking community support (e.g., support groups, home\\nhealth aide services, respite care, etc.), and a list of local\\nand national resources related to stroke.\\nBoth RT and MEUC were delivered in addition to\\nusual care. Usual care in the Neuro-ICU included med-\\nical care, nurse monitoring, and specialty care services\\n(physical, occupational, and speech-language therapists,\\nrespiratory therapy, chaplaincy). Usual care after dis-\\ncharge typically includes specialty care services (e.g.,\\nspeech, physical therapy) as determined by the medical\\nteam.\\nRecruitment, screening, and consent\\nPatients were identified by study staff who checked the\\nelectronic medical record for newly admitted stroke pa-\\ntients. Next, study staff approached potential partici-\\npants, described the study, and completed screening for\\neligibility. Eligible stroke patients included those (1) over\\nage 18, (2) with demonstrated English fluency and liter-\\nacy, (3) who suffered an acute stroke (hemorrhagic and\\nischemic) within maximum 1 week prior to recruitment,\\n(4) who had a caregiver also willing to participate, and\\n(5) medically and cognitively cleared for participation by\\nthe medical team. Eligible caregivers included those\\nwho: (1) were over age 18, (2) demonstrated English flu-\\nency and literacy, and (3) were the primary caregivers of\\na patient admitted with an acute stroke. Within each\\ndyad, either the patient or caregiver had to screen in for\\nclinically significant symptoms of depression, anxiety, or\\nPTS. This criterion ensures risk for chronic emotional\\ndistress within a dyad, based on prior research [35–37].\\nDyads were excluded if they were unable or unwilling to\\nparticipate in in-person and video sessions, or complete\\nfollow up measures electronically or over the phone. If\\ndyads elected to participate, study staff gave the dyad\\nphysical copies of the treatment manuals/pamphlets\\n(condition dependent), installed the secure Virtual Visit\\nsoftware (i.e., Vidyo) on their electronic device, and\\nscheduled the dyad’s first session with the clinician who\\nsubsequently scheduled all sessions with the dyad at the\\nend of each session/module.\\nAssessments\\nFollowing the informed consent process, dyads com-\\npleted self-report questionnaires in the Neuro-ICU at\\nthe time of study enrollment (baseline), assisted by study\\nstaff, as needed. They completed a similar set of ques-\\ntionnaires after the 6-week study period (post-test), and\\nagain 3 months after enrollment (3 month).\\nDemographic questionnaires\\nPatient and caregiver questionnaires assessed age, gen-\\nder, race/ethnicity, employment status, marital status,\\neducational level, and mental health history (Table 2).\\nThe Hospital Depression and Anxiety Scale (HADS)\\n[38] is a widely used, reliable, and valid measure for\\nsymptoms of depression and anxiety.

A review of 15 studies reported average in-\\nternal reliability for the HADS; internal reliability ranged\\nfrom questionable to excellent for both the anxiety\\n(HADS-A; mean α = 82; range .67 to .90) and depression\\n(HADS-D; mean α = 83; range .68 to .93) subscales [39].\\nIn the current sample, internal reliability was good for\\npatients (α = .86) and was excellent for caregivers (α =\\n.92) for the HADS-A, and similar across time points. For\\nthe HADS-D, internal reliability was good for caregivers\\n(α = .82) and questionable for patients (α = .66), though\\ninternal reliability improved at post-test and the 3-\\nmonth follow up (α = .71 and .75). Minimally important\\nclinical differences (MCIDs) for HADS subscales are be-\\ntween 1.5 and 1.7 [40, 41].\\nThe PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C) [42] is\\na valid and reliable measure of post-traumatic stress\\n(PTS) symptom severity. There are 17-items scored on a\\n5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 “not at all” to 5 “ex-\\ntremely”. Total severity scores, as well as clinically sig-\\nnificant, are generated by summing all items. A review\\nof 135 studies including the PCL-C indicated that the\\nmeasure demonstrated excellent internal consistency\\nacross studies (α = 93) [43]. Higher PCL-C scores sug-\\ngest worse symptom severity. The PCL-C had good in-\\nternal reliability for patients (α = .86) and was excellent\\nfor caregivers (α = .92) in our sample. Clinically signifi-\\ncant symptoms are determined by following an algo-\\nrithm based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for\\nMental Disorders (DSM) criteria being met (B-D) with\\nsymptoms endorsement in the moderate or above range.\\nA 10-point improvement in symptoms is considered\\nclinically meaningful [44].\\nThe General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSE) [45] is a 10-item\\nmeasure of ability to resourcefully manage challenging\\nsituations.

Pilot and Feasibility Studies (2020) 6:75\\nPage 6 of 16\\ntime points, consistent with previous studies involving\\nthe GSE [46].\\nThe Measure of Current Status Part A (MOCS-A) [47]\\nis a measure validated in medically-ill populations that\\nassesses an individual’s ability to employ various coping\\nskills, including relaxation techniques, acknowledgment\\nof stress and tension, ability to be assertive, and altering\\nnegative thought patterns, as a responsive to daily life\\nstressors. The 13-items are answered on a 5-point Likert\\nscale with responses ranging from 0 “I cannot do this at\\nall” to 4 “I can do this extremely well.” Total coping\\nscores are generated by summing all items. Higher\\nscores suggest more efficient coping techniques. In the\\ncurrent sample, internal reliability was acceptable for pa-\\ntients (α = .78) and excellent (α = .95 or higher) for care-\\ngivers in the sample, which is similar to the coefficients\\nreported in published studies of NICU caregivers (α =\\n0.91) [13].\\nThe\\nCognitive\\nand\\nAffective\\nMindfulness\\nScale-\\nRevised (CAMS) [48] is a valid and reliable measure of\\nthe extent to which individuals experience thoughts and\\nfeelings within the present moment. The 12-item meas-\\nure is scored using a 4-point Likert scale from 1 “rarely\\nor not at all” to 4 “almost always.” Total mindfulness\\nscores are computed by summing all the items, with\\ngreater\\nscores\\nsuggesting\\ngreater\\nmindfulness.\\nThe\\nCAMS-R demonstrates poor to good internal reliability\\n(αs from .61 to .85) across studies [49, 50]. In the\\npresent sample, the CAMS-R demonstrated good reli-\\nability for caregivers (α = .86), and questionable internal\\nreliability for patients (α = .54) at baseline, though im-\\nproved to excellent at post-test and good at 3 months (α\\n= .90 and .87).\\nThe Intimate Bond Measure (IBM) [51] is a measure\\nof participants’ perception of the quality of their inter-\\naction with their caregiver or patient, specifically asses-\\nsing domains of control by one’s partners and perceived\\ncare. The 24-items are scored on a 4-point Likert scale\\nwith responses from 0 “not at all true” to 3 “very true.”\\nItems about partner’s perceived control are reverse\\nscored and summed with the remaining care items.\\nHigher scores suggest higher perceived care and lower\\npartner control. Previous studies have found internal re-\\nliability coefficients that ranged from questionable to\\ngood (α from 0.68 to 0.83) [52]. In this sample, the IBM\\nshowed poor internal reliability for patients (α = .54),\\nthough improved to questionable at post-test (α = .64)\\nand good (α = .83) at 3 months. Internal reliability was\\ngood for caregivers (α = .85) at baseline and similar\\nacross time points.\\nAt pre-test, participants completed the Credibility and\\nExpectancy Questionnaire (CEQ) [53], a 6-item measure\\nof treatment expectancy and rationale credibility for\\nclinical outcome studies. The measure has two subscales\\nthat demonstrate differential predictive validity among\\nmedical populations [54] (1) cognitively based credibility\\nand (2) affectively based expectancy. Possible scores\\nrange from 3 to 27 for both the credibility and the ex-\\npectancy subscales, with higher scores indicating higher\\nperceived credibility/expectancy. In the validation study,\\nthe CEQ had a total standardized alpha coefficient (both\\nfactors) of .85. In the present sample, the credibility scale\\ndemonstrated excellent internal reliability for patients (α\\n= .90) and caregivers (α = .91). The expectancy scale\\ndemonstrated good internal reliability for patients (α =\\n.87) and acceptable reliability for caregivers (α = .74).\\nAt post-test, participants completed the Client Satis-\\nfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-3) [55, 56], a 3-item meas-\\nure of satisfaction with the program. The CSQ-3 has\\nbeen used to measure psychotherapy treatment satisfac-\\ntion among individuals with depression [57], chronic\\npain [58], and other physical conditions [59]. Items are\\nscored on a 4-point Likert scale, with higher scores indi-\\ncating greater satisfaction with delivery of care, satisfac-\\ntion with clinician, and overall program satisfaction.\\nInternal reliability in this sample was excellent for both\\npatients (α = .90) and for caregivers (α = .95), and simi-\\nlar to those reported across studies of client satisfaction\\n[60].\\nThere were no changes to assessment or measurement\\nprocedures after the trial commenced.\\nFeasibility and acceptability\\nFeasibility of recruitment was assessed by determining\\nthe number of patients approached in the Neuro-ICU\\nwho agreed to participate (% screened/% enrolled).\\nAcceptability of randomization and procedures was\\ndetermined by measuring the number of participants\\nwho elected to discontinue after they learned their\\nrandomization status.\\nAcceptability of study procedures was determined by\\nthe number of participants lost to follow-up (no post-\\ntest and 3-month follow-up) in both RT and MEUC.\\nAdherence to treatment was determined based on the\\nnumber of sessions attended by participants in RT con-\\ndition. Dyads were considered adherent if they attended\\nat least four out of six RT sessions.\\nFeasibility of quantitative measures was deemed ac-\\nceptable if no questionnaires were missing in full in\\nmore than 25% of participants and if reliability was\\nhigher than .70 for each questionnaire individually.\\nRandomization and allocation concealment\\nParticipants were randomized 1:1 to RT or MEUC (sim-\\nple randomization). Patient baseline materials contained\\nsealed envelopes. Envelopes were opened by study clini-\\ncians after dyads completed the recruitment and screen-\\ning\\nprocess,\\nconsented\\nto\\nstudy\\nparticipation,\\nand\\nBannon et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies (2020) 6:75\\nPage 7 of 16\\ncompleted the baseline measures. Because we compared\\nRT with a minimally enhanced control condition, nei-\\nther the dyad nor the therapist was blind to condition.\\nIdentification of study limitation to inform the future trial\\nThe study principal investigator (PI) maintained a con-\\nstant dialog with the study staff who collected data, the\\nstudy therapists, Neuro-ICU nurses and medical staff, as\\nwell as patients and their caregivers. Bi-weekly team\\nmeetings with nursing staff were also held to discuss\\nfeasibility issues. The study team documented issues re-\\nlated to recruitment, retention, assessments, and inter-\\nvention delivery throughout the study to identify and\\nremedy any limitations that were not previously consid-\\nered. No changes were made to session content or treat-\\nment delivery. Finally, we monitored any adverse events\\nin\\nboth\\nintervention\\ngroups,\\nnone\\nof\\nwhich\\nwere\\nobserved.\\nData analyses\\nThe current study was a feasibility trial designed to\\ninform a hybrid efficacy-effectiveness trial [31, 32]; as\\nsuch, it was not designed to detect a treatment effect\\n[61, 62]. Feasibility trials primarily report descriptive\\nstatistics on variables, as well as information on re-\\ncruitment, acceptability of screening, randomization,\\nand quantitative assessments. For the active treatment\\ncondition (RT), we report treatment satisfaction and\\nperceived\\ncredibility.\\nData\\nwere\\nexamined\\nwithin-\\ntreatment and -subject (patients and caregivers separ-\\nately) in RT and MEUC. First, we present descriptive\\nstatistics (means and standard deviations) for the out-\\ncome variables at each time point. Next, we present\\nwithin-subjects changes and effect sizes for improve-\\nment from baseline to post-test and from post-test to\\n3 months using Cohen’s d separately for patients and\\ncaregivers, and by treatment group (RT vs. control).\\nWe specify whether these improvements are above\\nthe MCIDs for depression, anxiety, and PTS. Finally,\\nwe report frequency of patients and caregivers with\\nclinically significant symptoms of depression, anxiety,\\nand PTS at all time points. There were no interim\\nanalyses or stopping rules for this feasibility study.\\nResults\\nSample\\nBaseline participant characteristics are presented in\\nTable 2 for patients and caregivers, separately for the RT\\nand MEUC. Patients were gender balanced and in ma-\\njority white and educated. Conditions were comparable\\nin terms of age and racial and ethnic distribution.\\nFeasibility of recruitment\\nWe report the number of individuals referred for screen-\\ning, approached for further screening, and consented\\n(see Fig. 1 for a CONSORT diagram of the study). Over\\nthe course of 1 year, a total of 296 new stroke patients\\nhospitalized in the Neuro-ICU were identified based on\\nthe medical record. Of those, 19 declined screening, 135\\nwere discharged before they could be approached by the\\nstudy team for screening, and 102 potential dyads did\\nnot meet initial screening criteria (one through five), in\\nmajority due to altered mental status. The remaining 40\\ndyads\\nwho\\nmet\\nthese\\ninitial\\ncriteria\\nwere\\nfurther\\nscreened for emotional distress using the HADS and\\nPCL. Of these 40, 23 dyads (58%) met criteria of risk for\\nchronic emotional distress by having at least one person\\n(patient or caregiver) that endorsed clinically significant\\nsymptoms of either depression, anxiety, or PTS. Of these\\n23 dyads, three (13%) declined to consent after screen-\\ning. Twenty dyads completed the informed consent\\nprocess. Three of the 20 consented dyads (15%) declined\\nto enroll after the informed consent process. The\\nremaining 17 dyads were randomized seven to interven-\\ntion and ten in control. One dyad in the control condi-\\ntion dropped out of the study after enrollment and\\nrandomization procedures, but prior to the completion\\nof baseline measures, citing concerns about finishing\\nstudy procedures prior to discharge (see Fig. 1).\\nAcceptability of randomization\\nThe CONSORT diagram (Fig. 1) shows the flow of par-\\nticipants in the study. Acceptability of randomization\\nwas excellent, and no RT dyads refused to participate in\\nthe study after randomization to condition.\\nAcceptability of study procedures\\nAmong RT dyads, acceptability of study procedures was\\nhigh. All dyads provided post-test data (n = 7; 100%),\\nand all but one dyad (n = 6; 85%) provided 3-month\\nfollow-up. All dyads who completed baseline measures\\nin the MEUC condition provided post-test data (n = 9;\\n100%), and all but one dyad (n = 8; 88.9%) provided 3-\\nmonth follow-up.\\nTreatment adherence was good, with four of the seven\\ndyads in RT attending 6/6 sessions, two dyads attending\\n4/6 sessions, and one dyad failing to attend any sessions\\nbecause the caregiver lived in a different state, worked\\nfull time, and could not travel to the Neuro-ICU during\\nregular hours and study staff was unable to install the\\nvideo software prior to discharge.\\nFeasibility of quantitative measures\\nFeasibility of quantitative measures was high. All par-\\nticipants\\nin\\nboth\\ntreatment\\nconditions\\ncompleted\\nbaseline measures and there was minimal missing\\nBannon et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies (2020) 6:75\\nPage 8 of 16\\ndata. One caregiver in the RT condition and one dyad (pa-\\ntient and caregiver) in the MEUC condition failed to\\ncomplete post-test measures. Completion of the 3-month\\nmeasures was also high, and 14 of the 17 dyads com-\\npleted\\nall\\nquantitative\\nmeasures\\n(six\\nRT,\\neight\\nMEUC). Of the participants that completed question-\\nnaires, no measure/inventory was missing in full. For\\ncaregivers, internal consistency of measures was high\\nfor all measures. For patients, internal reliability was\\nacceptable to excellent in most measures except the\\nIBM, and the HADS-D and CAMS-R, which both im-\\nproved after baseline and had similar baseline coeffi-\\ncients to those reported in previous studies [39].\\nTreatment credibility and expectancy\\nAverage credibility and expectancy ratings were high for\\nboth RT and MEUC patients and caregivers (Table 3).\\nSatisfaction with program\\nNeither patients nor therapists reported substantial chal-\\nlenges with the video platform and were satisfied with\\nthe live, remote delivery using their computers, tablets,\\nor phones. Many patients and caregivers expressed en-\\nthusiasm and gratitude for the video platform, which did\\nnot require travel to the hospital in-person. Treatment\\nsatisfaction (CSQ-3) was rated at post-test and was high\\nfor both conditions, though higher for dyads in the RT\\ncondition (Table 3).\\nMeans, standard deviations, and ranges\\nMeans, standard deviations, and ranges for all study out-\\ncomes at each time point are depicted for patients and\\ntheir informal caregivers, separately for RT or MEUC in\\nTable 3.

Improvements in depression symptoms were seen\\nin RT caregivers at post-intervention that persisted\\nthrough the 3-month follow up, though RT patients'\\nrates remained stable (14.3%) throughout the study as-\\nsessment period. In MEUC dyads, we observed increases\\nin rates of clinically significant symptoms of depression,\\nanxiety, and PTS at post-intervention and 3 months.\\nDiscussion\\nWe conducted a randomized controlled feasibility trial\\nof a dyadic resiliency intervention (Recovering Together;\\nRT) versus a minimally enhanced usual care (MEUC)\\ncomparison, with the goal of informing the design and\\nconduct of a future hybrid efficacy-effectiveness study\\naimed at preventing chronic emotional distress in stroke\\npatients and their informal caregivers. Recruitment was\\nchallenging and many dyads were missed before study\\nstaff was able to approach. However, once recruited and\\nrandomized, dyads in the RT condition attended most\\nstudy sessions and nearly all dyads in both conditions\\ncompleted post-test and follow-up questionnaires. Attri-\\ntion was better than in other clinical protocols of stroke\\npatients and their informal caregivers [25]. There were\\nno technical issues associated with the delivery of RT via\\nsecure live video. The feasibility and acceptability of\\nstudy procedures was also high, though some question-\\nnaires demonstrated low internal reliability for patients\\nat baseline. Additional measures of study feasibility such\\nas credibility, expectancy, and satisfaction were also high.\\nThese results are encouraging and show that patients\\nTable 4 Percentage of participants meeting criteria for emotional disorders\\nBannon et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies (2020) 6:75\\nPage 12 of 16\\nwith stroke and their caregivers are generally receptive\\nto psychosocial interventions targeting prevention of\\nchronic emotional distress.\\nExploration of within-group effect sizes demonstrated\\nimprovement (decreased symptoms) in all emotional dis-\\ntress outcomes between baseline and post-test (moderate\\nto large effect sizes) in RT, with improvements over\\nMCIDs for anxiety and PTS in patients and for depres-\\nsion, anxiety, and PTS in caregivers. Symptoms in-\\ncreased slightly from post-test to 3 months for RT\\ndyads, though none of the changes were clinically signifi-\\ncant. In contrast, patients in the MEUC condition dem-\\nonstrated clinically significant increases in symptoms in\\nall emotional distress outcomes between baseline and\\npost-test (medium to large effect sizes) and caregivers\\n(above MCID for depression symptoms). Symptoms\\nslightly decreased from post-test to 3 months for MEUC\\ndyads, though all decreases were below MCID values.\\nOver the course of 3 months (baseline to 3 months), we\\nobserved a general improvement in emotional distress\\nfor dyads randomized to RT and a general deterioration\\nin symptoms for those in MEUC.\\nAcross all dyads, clinically significant symptoms of\\nanxiety and PTS symptoms were more common than\\nsymptoms of depression. We observed a substantial de-\\ncrease in frequency of both patients and caregivers with\\nclinically significant emotional distress from baseline to\\nboth post-intervention and 3 months for those random-\\nized to RT. Of note, in the RT condition, the percentage\\nof patients exhibiting clinically significant depression\\nsymptoms at baseline was low (14.3; one patient) and\\nremained stable; rates of clinically significant depression\\nsymptoms were higher in RT caregivers (28.6%; two\\ncaregivers) and improved to 0% at post-test and 3\\nmonths. In MEUC, rates of clinically significant depres-\\nsion, anxiety, and PTS remained stable or increased.\\nTaken together, these findings show evidence of poten-\\ntial benefit from RT in reducing risk for chronic anxiety\\nand PTS in both stroke patients and caregivers, but no\\nevidence for improvement in depression. This may be a\\nfunction of the small sample size with only seven cases\\nof depression, as well as stroke-related biochemical\\nchanges in depression, lack of skills in RT to properly\\ntarget depressive symptoms, or a combination of these\\nfactors. The substantial deterioration in symptoms ob-\\nserved in MEUC is consistent with prior studies which\\nshow that emotional distress at hospitalization predicts\\nfuture emotional distress in both patients and caregivers\\n[10, 16]. These findings underscore the need for pro-\\nactive intervention for prevention of emotional sequelae\\nthat occur in the wake of stroke for dyads [30].\\nThis feasibility trial allowed us to study and under-\\nstand challenges of conducting research in a high stress\\nand busy Neuro-ICU setting. There were many lessons\\nlearned (Table 5) which will be implemented in the fu-\\nture trial in order to streamline recruitment. One of the\\nmost challenging aspects of the study was reaching the\\nsubstantial volume of patients with stroke to evaluate\\neligibility. The Neuro-ICU admission rate is high, and\\nmany patients are hospitalized for only a few days, dur-\\ning which their exhaustion and medical acuity is high. It\\nwas difficult for study staff to determine, based on the\\nmedical record alone, which dyads would be likely to\\nmeet study criteria including medical clearance to par-\\nticipate. Although we screened as many dyads as pos-\\nsible, we likely missed many potentially eligible dyads\\nwhile screening many who ended up unable to partici-\\npate due to impaired medical or cognitive presentation.\\nTaken together, these findings highlight the need to\\nwork closely with the Neuro-ICU medical and nursing\\nteam\\nto\\nstreamline\\nrecruitment\\nso\\nthat\\nwe\\ncan\\napproached only those dyads who are medically and cog-\\nnitively cleared for participation by the medical team.\\nWith funding from the National Institute of Nursing\\nResearch, we are now conducting a proof of concept\\nRCT that enrolls at risk dyads with any acute brain in-\\njury, as our prior studies did not find any differences in\\nemotional distress by type of diagnoses [7–10, 15]. This\\nRCT also employs an attention placebo control matched\\nin time and dose with RT, in order to strengthen the in-\\nternal validity of findings. That is directly informed by\\nlessons learned from the current study (Table 5). This\\nRCT is directly informed by lessons learned from the\\ncurrent trial. Specifically, we have strengthened our col-\\nlaboration with the nursing team in the Neuro-ICU, so\\nthat nurses now see the value of our work and are\\ninvested in helping with the study. We engaged nurses\\nin the development and refinement of study procedures\\nincluding methodology for recruitment and retention,\\nhave identified a nurse champion who is the point of\\ncontact on all cases, and keep nurses actively involved\\nthrough monthly presentations and anonymous surveys\\nof engagement and satisfaction.\\nOur current recruitment strategies are more effective\\nand efficient. Each morning, study staff meets with the\\nnurse champion who identifies all potential participants\\nwho are medically and cognitively able to enroll. The\\nnurse champion or bedside nurse introduce the study\\nteam to the patient through a “warm hand-off” to in-\\ncrease buy in, coordinate screening of informal care-\\ngivers, as well as other services on the floor to ensure\\nuninterrupted time for consent, questionnaire adminis-\\ntration, and in-hospital sessions. We are now generally\\ncompleting enrollment and the first dyadic session in 1\\nday to minimize drop-off after screening or after consent\\nand before first sessions. We now adopt a more flexible\\napproach to screening patients for emotional distress.\\nWhile we approach participants as soon as possible after\\nBannon et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies (2020) 6:75\\nPage 13 of 16\\ndiagnoses, in situations where mental status is low or\\nthe medical team does not think the patient is able to\\nconsent and meaningfully participate, our team will ap-\\nproach patients at later timepoints prior to discharge.\\nWe are also flexible in conducting the in-hospital visits\\nand allow caregivers to participate virtually in cases\\nwhere the caregiver lives out of state and is unable to\\ncome to the clinic during hospital hours, and conduct\\nvisits early morning and evenings when needed.\\nWe also considered revisions to study measures in the\\ncurrent proof of concept RCT. Though we observed an\\nunusual pattern of uniform responding (SD = 0) among\\nRT caregivers, our measure of program acceptability has\\ndemonstrated utility in treatment studies for a number\\nof chronic medical conditions [58, 59], and was likely\\ndue to our small sample size (n = 6 caregivers). Further,\\nwe observed low internal reliability in some of our base-\\nline questionnaires administered to patients, though\\nmost were within or near the ranges of coefficients re-\\nported in published studies. Specifically, patients exhib-\\nited\\ninconsistent response patterns\\nto the IBM, a\\nmeasure of the patient-caregiver relationship that as-\\nsesses dyadic care and dyadic control. While outside of\\nthe scope of the present study, it is possible that the cir-\\ncumstances surrounding the hospitalization impacted\\npatient consistency in responding to the questionnaire\\nitems. For example, participants may have responded to\\nthe prompt that their partner, “Tends to control every-\\nthing I do,” considering orders from their medical team\\nto promote recovery. Recognizing that the IBM may\\nhave conflated expressions of care and concern, we in-\\nstead included the Dyadic Relationship Scale [63] as a\\nmeasure of positive dyadic interactions in our current\\nproof of concept RCT. Reliability for the DRS has also\\nbeen established in cognitively impaired patient popula-\\ntions [64]. Following ours and others observations that\\nsome patients’ responses may be impacted by cognitive\\nfunctioning [65], we are now ensuring the validity of pa-\\ntient measures in the hospital by checking patient’s\\nmental status before administration and by checking an-\\nswers to the reversed scored items immediately after\\nquestionnaire completion. Using these strategies, our\\nability to recruit participants has dramatically increased,\\nand we have enrolled 52 participants over the course of\\n8 months.\\nIn sum, the present feasibility randomized control trial\\nprovided valuable information for the design of future\\nstudies and further development of RT. Using lessons\\nlearned from this feasibility trial, we substantially im-\\nproved methodology and recruitment and are now con-\\nducting a proof of concept RCT where we explore\\ntreatment effects with a larger sample and pay particular\\nattention to addressing depressive symptoms where\\nthese are present. Investment in this proof of concept\\ntrial rather than directly conducting a fully powered\\nRCT is allowing us to test proposed methodologies and\\nlessons learned from this trial without the risk wasting\\ntime and resources. This is particularly important as\\nprior critical care trials aimed at preventing chronic\\nemotional distress after critical care admission have\\nfailed to show efficacy [66].\\nConclusions\\nWe conducted a feasibility trial of Recovering Together,\\nthe first dyadic intervention aimed at preventing chronic\\nemotional distress in at-risk stroke patients and their in-\\nformal caregivers, relative to minimally enhanced usual\\ncare (MEUC).

       " 'Introduction\\nTen million cases of traumatic brain injury (TBI) are reported worldwide each year\\n(Barman et al., 2011). TBI is one of the leading causes of mortality and disability\\nand has become a worldwide public health issue (Stålnacke et al., 2019). Accord-\\ning to an epidemiological survey (Huo et al., 2015), the incidence of TBI in China is\\nabout 240 cases for every 10 million people. However, because of the advances in\\ncritical medical technology, more patients with severe brain injury survive,\\nleading to a growing number of patients with disorders of consciousness\\n(DOC) in China (Xia et al., 2018). DOC are a collection of transitory syndromes,\\nencompassing coma, unresponsive wakefulness syndrome, and the minimally\\nconscious state (Graham, 2020). Patients with DOC, caused by severe brain\\ninjury, pose a great ﬁnancial strain on their families, increase burnout rates in\\nnursing, and give rise to ethical discussions (Schnakers & Monti, 2017).\\nNormally, healthcare professionals often inform patients of their condition\\nand treatment plan through informed consent, and the patients decide\\nwhether to continue treatment. However, DOC patients remain in a life-threa-\\ntening state with an uncertain prognosis for a long time, which can render\\nthem incapable to provide informed consent or refuse medical treatment\\n(Long et al., 2011). Moreover, cognitive impairments prevent DOC patients\\nfrom communicating eﬀectively (Landsness et al., 2011). Research indicates\\nthat 95% of them lack the ability to make decisions and express preferences\\n(Cai et al., 2015). For these reasons, their family members are regarded as\\ntheir surrogates and assist with medical decision-making (Sequeira & Lewis,\\n2017). Surrogate decision-makers may make clinical decisions about diagnostic\\nand surgical procedures, including life-sustaining interventions and end-of-life\\ncare. In addition, healthcare professionals will solicit them for guidance on\\nthe patient’s treatment preferences (Hickman & Pinto, 2014).\\nHowever, it is the ﬁrst time for most surrogates to encounter such an acci-\\ndent, and they are unsure of the desired health outcome their loved ones will\\nconsider acceptable (Turnbull et al., 2016). Decisional dilemmas and conﬂicts\\nare inherent in the decision-making process and present tremendous chal-\\nlenges to the family surrogate decision-makers. Since many surrogates are\\nunprepared to serve in this role, they are at risk for long-term adverse psycho-\\nlogical outcomes such as decision regret, decision fatigue, and symptoms of\\npost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (Zahuranec et al., 2018). It is reported\\nNEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL REHABILITATION\\n1583\\nthat 14%∼81% of the family members have symptoms of PTSD after participat-\\ning in the decision-making process (Petrinec & Daly, 2016). The prevalence of\\nPTSD exceeded 80% when the decision involved end-of-life decisions\\n(Azoulay et al., 2005).\\nFurther, the decision-making process may diﬀer by culture which directly\\naﬀects individual behaviours (Sun et al., 2020). Traditional Chinese culture\\nis deeply rooted in the ancient philosophies of Confucianism, Taoism, and\\nBuddhism. As a result, its cultural landscape is diverse rather than a mono-\\nlithic entity, which makes the surrogate decision-making process embody\\ncultural characteristics. For example, ﬁlial piety has been the essence of\\nChinese feudal ethics since ancient times. Besides, discussing the issue of\\nlife and death of seriously ill or dying patients is still a taboo subject in the\\nChinese context, which poses great challenges for eﬀective communication\\nbetween healthcare professionals and family members. In addition, Chinese\\nfamily culture is family-oriented, which means the family is a community of\\nlife (Wei et al., 2019). The individual’s disease and survival rights are shared\\nby the family, which plays a decisive role in making health decisions (Li &\\nZuo, 2016). Therefore, the cultural beliefs of family members may provide\\nfamily surrogate decision-makers with more challenges and complex\\ndecisions.\\nMany documented studies are mainly about the accuracy of surrogate\\ndecisions (Frey et al., 2014; Shalowitz et al., 2006), the underlying factors and\\nthe relations between outcomes of surrogate decision-making (Hammami\\net al., 2020; Spalding & Edelstein, 2022), and the extent of preference overlap\\nbetween surrogate decision-makers and patients (Frey et al., 2018). Nonethe-\\nless, little is known about the family surrogate decision-makers’ experience\\nduring the decision-making process. In addition, globalization trends promote\\nan increase in immigration and enables the spread of Chinese culture. As\\nreported (Guo et al., 2021; Stevenson et al., 2018), Chinese individuals are the\\nlargest Asian American group in the USA and is one of the largest visible min-\\nority groups in Canada, comprising 21% of Canada’s visible minority population.\\nThus, the purpose of this study is to explore Chinese family surrogate decision-\\nmakers’ perspectives of decision-making, amidst the diversity and uniqueness of\\nChinese culture. We hope the ﬁndings can provide healthcare professionals with\\nguidance regarding optimal decision-making for DOC patients with similar cul-\\ntural backgrounds from diﬀerent countries.\\nMethods\\nAim\\nThis study aimed to explore and describe the family surrogate decision-makers’\\nviews on the decision-making of patients with DOC.\\n1584\\nJ. CHEN ET AL.\\nDesign\\nThe qualitative thematic analysis approach (Vaismoradi et al., 2013) was\\nemployed to identify, analyse, and report themes within the concepts that\\nreﬂected family surrogate decision-makers’ perceptions of decision-making of\\npatients with DOC. Semi-structured face-to-face interviews that could allow par-\\nticipants to freely describe their experiences and emotions ﬂexibly were\\nadopted (Denzin, 2007).\\nParticipants\\nParticipants were purposively recruited from the neurological ICU of a tertiary\\nhospital in Shanghai, China. The researchers only contacted participants who\\nmatched the criteria to ensure voluntary participation. The inclusion criteria\\nas follows: family members should be 18 years old or older, be represented as\\na surrogate decision-maker of a patient who is diagnosed with DOC for the\\nﬁrst time and lacks decision-making capacity, and can speak and understand\\nMandarin.

All individuals voluntarily partici-\\npated, and received verbal and written informed consent about the study\\nbefore the interviews were carried out. The participants were informed of\\ntheir right to withdraw from the interviews at any time. The audio recordings\\nand transcripts were available for this study only, and will be destroyed once\\nthe study is ﬁnished.\\nData analysis\\nTwenty-one interviews were conducted. All audio recordings of the interviews\\nwere transcribed verbatim by the ﬁrst author. The authors then double-\\nchecked the transcripts for accuracy and returned them to the participants\\nfor veriﬁcation. After conﬁrming the accuracy of the transcripts, the ﬁrst\\nauthor translated them to English. Thereafter, the co-ﬁrst author and second\\nauthor checked the accuracy of the translation using a back-translation\\nmethod – wherein the English was translated back into Mandarin. Finally, the\\nco-corresponding author, who has a certiﬁcate of interpretation accreditation\\ntest and used to be a visiting scholar in the US, double-checked the translation.\\nThe English transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke,\\n2006) by (1) reading the transcripts in detail several times, in order to ensure\\nfamiliarity with the depth and breadth of their content; (2) formulating the\\nmeaningful statements relevant to the purpose of the study and encoding as\\nmany initial codes as possible; (3) sorting the diﬀerent codes into potential\\nthemes and building a collection of themes and sub-themes; (4) reviewing\\nthe themes, collapsing some themes into others, and breaking down some\\nthemes into smaller components; and (5) deﬁning and naming themes. In this\\nstudy, two researchers carried out the coding process of transcripts indepen-\\ndently. Thereafter, they compared and veriﬁed the themes until a consensus\\nwas reached.\\nTable 3.

(N18)\\nParticipants (n = 7) highlighted that the family members’ belief that nothing is\\nmore important than human life would inﬂuence the decision-making\\nprocess as well.

CHEN ET AL.\\nOur family said that they didn’t want their family to suﬀer a lot and live without quality\\nat the terminal stage. So, we decided to give up. (N8)\\nMoreover, participants (n = 10) indicated that when faced with patients in criti-\\ncal condition, they prioritised quality of life, as they believed that instead of\\nallowing patients to continue accepting advanced life support and maintain\\nlife without quality, it was better to let them pass away peacefully.\\nThe quality of life is poor. DOC patients have no quality of life and are, from my side,\\nunconscious and helpless. (N10)\\nHowever, some participants (n = 3) indicated that selecting the communi-\\ncation style to have other immediate family members make a rational judgment\\nabout giving life without quality up, has become an issue currently considered\\nin family meetings.\\nMy mother has neither dignity nor quality of life. I have told my father and sibling that if\\nshe can’t bear it, then give up, but I don’t know how to talk to them. (N4)\\nA major responsibility for patient’s voice\\nSince DOC patients lack decision-making capacity and cannot choose clinical\\ntreatment autonomously, family surrogate decision-makers should make\\ndecisions on behalf of them, which makes the family surrogate decision-\\nmakers shoulder the heavy responsibility of speaking out for the patients.\\nIf you don’t decide, who will make the decision? Only you can make the decision, you\\nhave to bear it. (N14)\\nThis heavy responsibility is also reﬂected when family surrogate decision-\\nmakers need to conceal the patient’s condition to certain members, such as\\nfamily members who have poor resilience, because they fear that the patient’s\\ncondition will deal a heavy blow to these family members. Family surrogate\\ndecision-makers often make decisions alone under these circumstances, and\\nthey will be under more pressure and assume more responsibilities.\\nI didn’t tell my sister [mother’s condition] because she was going to take the entrance\\nexamination for high school, and I made the decision by myself. (N3)\\nThe surrogate’s decision is usually related to the patient’s subsequent recovery,\\neven their lives. Therefore, this is also a huge challenge for the family surrogate\\ndecision-makers.\\nThis is my mother’s second chance to live. This decision is of great help to her later\\ntreatment. (N6)\\nComplex considerations between ethics and morals\\nSub-theme: The impact of kinship and ﬁlial piety on clinical decision-making\\nNEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL REHABILITATION\\n1589\\nFamily bond was one of the factors that inﬂuenced surrogate decision-\\nmaking. This emotional belief has not only become the main motivation for\\nfamily members not to give up, but has also become an indispensable part of\\ntheir lives. To this end, several family surrogate decision-makers show a reluc-\\ntance to let the patient go.\\nAﬀection was the greatest strength that supports our family members. My wife is 70-\\nyear-old woman who was out of hope [for] a cure, I have let go of [my] feelings and sold\\nour house for her treatment. (N21)\\nFurthermore, to guard against a perception from others that they are not\\nshowing appropriate ﬁlial piety and to gain social acceptability, family\\nmembers will do anything they can to rescue their family member.\\nTraditional Chinese thinking focuses on ﬁlial piety. I want to give up (stop treatment)\\nbut I am afraid of being blamed [for] an ungrateful attitude. Finally, I chose to adhere to\\nthe treatment. (N15)\\nIt is when your family suddenly becomes ill that you realize you don’t do your ﬁlial\\npiety. Then you want to do something for your family. (N17)\\nSub-theme: Diﬀerent understanding of illness experience\\nFamily members have diﬀerent perceptions of illness experience, especially\\nof the decisions regarding invasive procedures. Some family members who dis-\\napprove of such procedures think that the pain caused by invasive procedures\\noutweighs the suﬀering caused by the disease, while other family members\\nbelieve that carrying out invasive procedures could prevent and relieve the sec-\\nondary pain caused by the disease.\\nI cannot accept the tracheotomy, thinking the prognosis will be bad. (N12)\\nThe tracheotomy doesn’t matter compared with her current condition. Provided there\\nis a gleam of hope for her recovery, I will do it. (N8)\\nYet another perception is reﬂected when comatose patients are bound by phys-\\nical restraints, which is used commonly in the ICU. Since healthcare pro-\\nfessionals pay attention to the psychological pain suﬀered by conscious\\npatients, they can understand their stigma. For patients in a comatose state,\\nhowever, family members are often more focused on humanistic care.\\nAnother point is the use of restraint bands. I think it’s contrary to humanity.

When faced with cases that\\ncould not be solved by current medical practices, family members found them-\\nselves willing – but unable – to avail proper treatment for their family.\\nI feel that current medical technology can’t cure him. His condition is worse oﬀ, and the\\ncurrent technology can only be like this. (N6)\\nMore than half of the DOC patients in this study are from small rural towns,\\nwhere the medical standards and disproportionate medical conditions are not\\nconducive to further treatment of patients. Therefore, the family surrogate\\ndecision-makers will elect to transfer a patient to a developed area with\\nleading advanced medical standards at any cost.\\nThe doctor (of county town) advised us not to transfer. I said no. We said we must trans-\\nfer because the medical conditions in our county town are not good. (N7)\\nAlthough participants (n = 5) have encountered the limitations of the develop-\\nment of modern medicine during the treatment process, they were not discour-\\naged from rescuing patients. On the contrary, they were motivated and believe\\nthat healthcare professionals would seek the necessary research data to further\\nexplore treatment methods.\\nDespite [having] tried our best, we can only go this far. I think the development of\\nmedicine still requires persistent people to overcome the problems. If we don’t\\npersist, we may stand helpless when we encounter a similar [problem] next time. (N20)\\nSub-theme: Prognosis\\nSome participants described that in the decision-making process, the prog-\\nnosis of DOC patients should be addressed as a priority, and subsequent\\ndecisions will be based on their recovery. In the acute phase of the disease,\\nfamily surrogate decision-makers are mainly trying their best to save patients’\\nlives.\\nNow we mainly focus in saving her life.

Later, I will arrange division of care after she gets home. (N7)\\nDiscussion\\nTraditional Chinese culture emphasizes that the meaning of life lies in the\\npresent world (Hao, 2010). Therefore, many family members advocate for the\\ntheory of the sanctity of life. This conception also explained why family\\nNEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL REHABILITATION\\n1591\\nmembers were eager to prolong DOC patients’ lives. However, this did not\\nincrease the chances of survival, and could cause harm and result in the over-\\ntreatment of incurable patients (Dzeng & Curtis, 2018). Moreover, the patients’\\nfamily members would experience a higher symptom burden. McAdam et al.\\n(2010) indicated that 57% of family members had moderate to severe levels\\nof traumatic stress, and 70%∼80% of them had borderline symptoms of\\ndepression. In order to address the popular perception of life support treatment\\nand promote that of palliative care (Peden-McAlpine et al., 2015), as well as\\nimprove the quality of death of critically ill patients, healthcare professionals\\ncould provide an inpatient palliative care program. Enguidanos et al. (2014)\\nfound that communication and information received contributed to the\\nfamily members’ ability to make decisions. Furthermore this can make a distinct\\nchange in clinical direction, from a traditional disease-centred approach to a\\nholistic approach focusing on quality of life and comfort.\\nThe challenges of discussing prognosis of DOC patients among families\\nrevealed that the taboo of talking about death and dying had permeated\\nChinese culture. In this study, the participants realised their total responsibility\\nto serve in the role of a surrogate decision-maker; meanwhile, they were ﬁlled\\nwith moral unease when communicating with other family members of dying\\npatients, as they were worried that the end-of-life decision could crush other\\nfamily members’ spirits. A cohort study found that surrogate decision-makers’\\nbeliefs during a discussion on death could be emotionally damaging to their\\nfamily members (Apatira et al., 2008). In Chinese society, people make use of\\nimplicit communication. They do not spell everything out, but leave the\\n“unspoken” meaning to the listeners (Liu et al., 2005). In addition, some\\nfamily surrogate decision-makers will think twice before talking to their rela-\\ntives. Thus, it is essential for healthcare professionals to understand the cul-\\ntural sensitivity in such a context, as this could strengthen supportive\\ncommunication and show greater consideration for families’ feelings (Tao\\net al., 2016).\\nOur ﬁndings highlighted that 52% of family surrogate decision-makers are\\npatients’ children. The ﬁlial piety is a major emotional factor and impetus for\\nthem to make surrogate decisions. Family ethics is vital to maintaining a\\nfamily bond and is a common emotional behaviour criterion (Qiu et al., 2018)\\nthat regulates the relationship between children and their parents (Ruan &\\nZhou, 2019). Whether children engage in the active treatment of their parents\\nhas become a standard for moral judgment. Thus, healthcare professionals\\nmay face more challenges when telling families that withdrawing life-sustaining\\ntreatment is another way to practice ﬁlial piety. Therefore, healthcare pro-\\nfessionals should take actions to popularise bereavement support, set grieving\\nfamilies free from public pressure, and promote the understanding that it is\\nhuman beings’ great love that turns kinship into a spirituality concern (Zhang\\net al., 2019).\\n1592\\nJ. CHEN ET AL.\\nIt was revealed that family surrogate decision-makers had diﬀerent under-\\nstandings of illness experience. According to Confucian familyism, the holistic\\nwisdom of the family is greater than that of the individual, since families\\nbelieve that they can make the optimal decision for the patient (Sun, 2017).\\nRolland et al. (2017) posed that if family systems were included in medical\\ndecision-making, medical decisions could be less conﬂicted and less emotional\\nsuﬀering would be felt by both clinicians and families. However, our ﬁndings\\nprovided insight that some medical decisions would contradict the actual con-\\ndition of the patient and hamper clinical operation implementation. This indi-\\ncates that the perception of illness experience of family members was\\ndiﬀerent, and to some extent, not sympathetic. Thus, healthcare professionals\\nshould respect the decisions of families and combine their illness experience\\nwith ethical principles and medical interests. Besides, Wong et al. (2020)\\nfound when healthcare professionals communicated with family members\\nclearer, were more transparent and interacted with patience and empathy,\\nand were responsive to their concerns, family members were less stressed\\nand respected.\\nIn this study, when patients’ vital signs decreased, family members could do\\nnothing but feel sympathy, due to the limitations of critical care technology and\\nthe uncertain prognosis. This emotional exhaustion aﬀects surrogate decision-\\nmakers’ physical and mental health. The persistent state of heightened\\nemotional distress can destroy surrogate decision makers’ internal and external\\nﬂexible resource, resulting in a state of ego depletion (Hickman et al., 2018).\\nMoreover, the psychological distress of critical illness and state of high negative\\nemotions can inﬂuence decision-makers’ ability to formulate optional decisions\\n(Hickman & Douglas, 2010). Consequently, in order to improve the psychologi-\\ncal resilience of family surrogate decision-makers, healthcare professionals\\nshould actively address existing psychological problems and enhance family\\nsurrogate decision-makers’ abilities to react positively despite the diﬃculties\\nencountered – turning these situations into opportunities for growth (Sisto\\net al., 2019).\\nLimitations\\nThe study had some limitations. Firstly, the researchers’ native language is Man-\\ndarin. This may have resulted in misinterpretations during the translation stage.\\nNevertheless, the researchers veriﬁed the accuracy of the translations during\\neach step to ensure their trustworthiness. Secondly, all 21 participants were\\nmarried, which could contribute to bias. The participants’ perspectives on the\\nsame issue could diﬀer due to the responsibility of family. Therefore, more\\ndiverse target groups should be enrolled in future studies. Thirdly, the hospital\\nwhere the participants were selected is situated in a developed coastal city of\\nChina. Since the development of medical technology and level of consumption\\nNEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL REHABILITATION\\n1593\\nmay diﬀer cross regions, further research on the medical settings of developing\\nregions is needed. Fourthly, the participants were selected according to the\\nstate of consciousness of the patients instead of the process of the disease.\\nTherefore, we were unable to identify participants’ perspectives of decision-\\nmaking about diﬀerent stage of the disease, like the acute versus stable stage.\\nConclusions\\nIn the neurological ICU, decision-making for DOC patients is signiﬁcantly more\\ndiﬃcult than for conscious patients. These ﬁndings hinted at the family surro-\\ngate decision-makers’ experiences and decisional dilemmas in decision-\\nmaking for DOC patients under the Chinese culture framework. The results\\nemphasize the need for healthcare professionals to oﬀer decision-making assist-\\nance to family surrogate decision-makers and pay attention to their psychologi-\\ncal needs so that informed decisions could be formulated. To best protect the\\nrights and make the surrogate decisions in the best interest of DOC patients,\\nfurther research on improving the collaboration between healthcare pro-\\nfessionals and family surrogate decision-makers in the diversity of care of\\nDOC patients, such as the role of shared decision-making, should be conducted.',\n",

Introduction\\nPeople with stroke may suffer from difﬁculties associated with\\neating and drinking due to impaired consciousness, swallowing\\ndeﬁcits, reduced mobility, and arm or facial weakness, fatigue, and\\nvisual-perceptual impairment. These patients are therefore at risk\\nof disease-related malnutrition [1]. Dysphagia, difﬁculty with\\nswallowing, is common after acute stroke, occurring in 20%e65% of\\npatients. The great variation in prevalence can depend on the\\nheterogeneity of the patient population, timing of nutritional\\nassessment and the diagnostic method used. Nutritional impair-\\nment can lead to serious complications outcomes (e.g., prolonged\\nhospital stay, developing infections, decreased quality of life, higher\\nmortality rates), in patients with both ischemic and hemorrhagic\\nstroke [2e7]. For this reason, nutrition should be considered as part\\nof stroke treatment [8]. Nutrition support is recommended for\\nmalnourished patients with stroke who are unable to obtain\\nenough protein and calorie. If the patient with stroke is able to\\nconsume food or ﬂuid orally and consume sufﬁcient quantities, oral\\nnutritional intake should be provided; however, PEG tube place-\\nment should be considered if neurological deﬁcit cause impairment\\nin ability to obtain sufﬁcient oral intake [4,8].

In patients with acute stroke and dysphagia, to\\nprevent complications resulting from the energy-protein deﬁcit,\\nenteral nutrition with a nasogastric tube or through percutaneous\\nendoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) should be provided until swallowing\\ndifﬁculties improve or the patient is able to consume orally [9,10].\\nA high number of stroke patients with PEG tend to be older and\\ndependent. Therefore, these group of patients require a caregiver to\\nsupport them. Family caregivers of stroke patients have been re-\\nported to have stress, anxiety, exhaustion, isolation, and lower\\nquality of life because of heavy responsibility [11e13]. Due to the\\nunpredictable nature of stroke recovery, caregiving generally leads\\nto being burden on family members or relatives of patients with\\nstroke. It is evident that there is a higher risk of psychiatric\\nsymptoms among the caregivers of chronic illnesses as compared\\nto the general population [14]. Using PEG to feed patients with\\nstroke may be considered as a stressor factor for caregivers in their\\ndaily lives. However, no recent study has been conducted on the\\nrole of nutrition in the burden of caregivers of patients with stroke.\\nThe present study aimed to provide new data on the nutritional\\nburden on caregivers comparing the burden and depression levels\\namong caregivers of ischemic stroke patients fed by PEG and orally.\\n2. Methods\\n2.1. Participants\\nThe prospective and cross-sectional study was approved by the\\nEthics Committee of the University of KTO Karatay where the study\\nwas performed (approval number: 41901325e050.99) and carried\\nout in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants\\nsigned an informed consent form. This study was conducted in\\ncaregivers of stroke patients who had been followed in our\\nneurology department from January 2017 to January 2018. Ischemic\\nstroke patients were selected to obtain a homogeneous patient\\ngroup. The reason for an insertion of a PEG tube in these stroke\\npatients was a clinical manifestation of swallowing difﬁculties. The\\npatients were stratiﬁed into 2 groups: patients who were fed by\\nPEG and patients who were fed orally. The study inclusion criteria\\nwere: 1) Caregivers of ischemic stroke patients with Modiﬁed\\nRankin Score (mRS) 4 or 5; 2) patients who were fed by PEG or\\norally; 3) caregiving at least 3 months by the same person. Subjects\\nwere excluded if: 1) the patients had hemorrhagic stroke; 2) the\\npatient had PEG tubes used for other conditions; 3) other neuro-\\nlogical or psychiatric diseases were present; 4) the caregiver had\\nbeen assigned by professional health care companies; 6) the care-\\ngiver was earlier diagnosed mental illness and used psychiatric\\nmedications. Patients with similar stroke severity and dependency\\naccording to mRS were enrolled. All of the patients were fed by\\ntheir caregivers. The patients who were fed orally did not have a\\nnasogastric catheter or intravenous route and patients using PEG\\nwere not fed orally. All of the caregivers of the patients using PEG\\nhad been trained regarding PEG tube use and care.\\nOne hundred thirty-seven ischemic stroke patients were eval-\\nuated during the study period. Six patients who had developed\\nintracerebral haemorrhage, 5 patients whose caregivers had\\nchanged, 63 patients with mRS score 1 to 3 were excluded. A total of\\n63 patients and their caregivers were ﬁnally enrolled in the study.\\n2.2. Procedures\\n2.2.1. Sociodemographic data form\\nThe data of the caregivers on sociodemographic variables such\\nas age, gender, income, level of education and kinship to patient\\nwere recorded.\\n2.2.2. Evaluation of caregivers’ thoughts of nutrition support\\ntherapy\\nA semi-structured questionnaire consisting of 5 questions was\\ndeveloped by the authors relating to the aim of this study based on\\nrelevant literature and the authors' experience. The questionnaire\\nwas conducted by the researchers to evaluate caregivers’ experi-\\nence of feeding. The items on the questionairre are answered in a 5-\\npoint Likert format of 1e5 corresponding to strongly disagree,\\ndisagree, neither agree nor disagree, agree and strongly agree. A\\nhigher score indicates higher positive thinking.\\nThe questions are listed below:\\n1. Do you think that feeding your patient is easy?\\n2. Do you think that feeding method of your patient is safe?\\n3. Do you think that your patient receives adequate nutrition?\\n4. Does feeding method of patient inﬂuence the workload of the\\ncaregiver?\\n5. Does feeding method of patient reduce caregiver's social\\ndisability?\\n2.2.3. The Beck Depression Inventory\\nThe Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) is a 21-question, multiple-\\nchoice,\\nself-report\\ninventory\\nfor\\nmeasuring\\nthe\\nseverity\\nof\\ndepression [15]. Each question has 4 alternative options and the\\nparticipants are asked to select the option that best describes their\\nfeelings for the last seven days among the options scored between\\n0 and 4. The total score ranges from 0 to 63 and higher scores\\nindicate more severe depressive symptoms. Turkish validity and\\nreliability of the BDI were made by Hisli et al. [16].\\n2.2.4. The Zarit Burden Interview\\nThe Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) evaluates the subjective\\nexperience of caregiver burden quantitatively [17]. ZBI consists of\\n22 questions with 5 possible answers (never, rarely, sometimes,\\nquite frequently or nearly always). These questions assess the\\nimpact of caregiving on the physical and emotional health, social\\nactivities and ﬁnancial status of the caregiver. The total score ranges\\nbetween 0 and 88 points. Higher scores on the inventory indicate\\nhigher levels of burden. The application of the scale in Turkish has\\nbeen tested for validity and reliability [18].\\n2.3. Statistical analysis\\nSPSS\\n23.0\\nwas\\nused\\nas\\nthe\\nstatistical\\nanalysis\\nprogram.\\nDescriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, frequency, and\\npercentage) were used for demographic and clinical characteristics.\\nThe ManneWhitney U test is used to compare differences between\\ntwo independent groups. Pearson's Chi-square test was used for the\\ncomparison of categorical variables. The Spearman rank correlation\\nwas used for correlation analyses. P < 0.05 was considered signif-\\nicant in all statistical analyses.\\n3. Results\\nSixty-three stroke patients and their caregivers were assessed.\\nThirty-two stroke patients on PEG (age 76.59 ± 7.99; range: 62e84;\\n12 male) and 31 stroke patients feeding orally (age 79.83 ± 7.09;\\nrange: 66e89; 14 male) did not have a statistically signiﬁcant dif-\\nference on mean age, gender, and mRS scores (p > 0.05). De-\\nmographic characteristics of the caregivers of stroke patients on\\nPEG and feeding orally are shown in Table 1. In addition, there was\\nno signiﬁcant difference in terms of income of the relatives of the\\npatients (p > 0.05). No statistically signiﬁcant differences were\\nD.H. Ertem, F.

No differences in depression levels were\\ndetected according to the BDI (p ¼ 0.42). The mean burden score on\\nthe ZBI for caregivers of stroke patients on PEG was 41.68 ± 5.72,\\nrepresenting a moderate burden and 49 ± 5.63 for caregivers of\\norally fed stroke patients which also indicates a moderate burden.\\nHowever, the type of nutritional feeding affected the results. Thus,\\nthe mean burden score of caregivers was higher in oral feeding over\\nPEG (p ¼ 0.00). Table 3 shows the survey results of caregiver's\\nopinions about patient's nutritional care. Caregivers of stroke pa-\\ntients on PEG had a higher scores of caregivers' satisfaction of\\nnutrition support therapy questionnaire indicating higher level of\\npositive thinking on their patient's feeding. In the correlation an-\\nalyses, there were no correlation between BDI and ZBI (p ¼ 0.722\\nrho ¼ \\x02,046).\\n4. Discussion\\nThe aim of this study is to examine the effects of type of feeding\\non depression and caregiver burden in the caregivers of ischemic\\nstroke patients population. The ﬁndings of this study demonstrated\\nthat even though both caregivers of stroke patients on PEG and who\\nwere fed orally had moderate caregiver burden, caregivers with PEG\\nfeeding reported lower burden and higher satisfaction than care-\\ngivers with oral feeding. Patient's nutritional status did not affect\\ndepressive symptoms of caregivers. In addition, according to the\\nresults of questionnaire we developed, caregivers of stroke patients\\non PEG stated that they found feeding with PEG easy and safe and\\napplicable to reduce their workload. It can be concluded that lower\\nscores of ZBI in stroke patients with PEG might be considered as the\\npatient was adequately fed and this caused a decrease in the work-\\nload and better functioning in caregiver's social life.\\nRecent studies reported that half of the patients with severe\\nstroke were malnourished at some point during their hospital stay\\nif longer than three weeks and in poststroke patients and the\\nprevalence of malnutrition was found nearly 60% [19,20]. Malnu-\\ntrition, dehydration, weight loss, fatigue, aspiration pneumonia and\\neven higher mortality risk may arise in stroke over the course of the\\ndisease with the decreased ability to swallow [10]. It is well\\nestablished that PEG tubes provide an actual beneﬁt to the patient\\nand his caregiver on long-term quality of life. Nonetheless, there is a\\nlack of studies investigating the relationship between feeding type\\nin patients with stroke and the caregiver burden.\\nIn the study by Caro et al., they evaluated the burden and quality\\nof life of family caregivers of patients with stroke [12]. They found\\nthat moderate burden was associated with an increased risk of\\ndepression and had effects on emotional health. The authors\\nexplained the reduction in burden by patients' cognitive decline,\\nrestricted physical mobility, old age, demand for intimate care, and\\ncarer being married. Our work differs from this study in terms of\\nsome features. First, in their study, they did not explore the effects\\nof the type of feeding on caregiver's burden. Secondly, their sample\\nTable 1\\nDemographic characteristics of caregivers.\\nCaregivers of stroke patients on PEG\\nCaregivers of orally fed stroke patients\\nP values\\nNumber\\n32\\n31\\n0.98\\nAge (years)\\n49.56 ± 9.50\\n50.19 ± 8.87\\n0.80\\nGender\\nMale\\n9\\n12\\n0.37\\nFemale\\n23\\n19\\nMarital status\\nSingle\\n10\\n10\\n0.93\\nMarried\\n22\\n21\\nLevel of Education\\nUneducated\\n11\\n10\\n0.97\\nPrimary school\\n15\\n16\\nHigh school\\n4\\n3\\nUniversity\\n2\\n2\\nKinship to patient\\nSpouse\\n8\\n10\\n0.48\\nDaughters/sons\\n16\\n12\\nDaughter-in-law\\n6\\n7\\nOthers\\n2\\n2\\nTable 2\\nMean depression and burden scores of caregivers.\\nCaregivers of stroke patients on PEG\\nCaregivers of orally fed stroke patients\\nP values\\nMean BDI scores\\n15.37 ± 5.92\\n16.32 ± 5.28\\n0.42\\nMean ZBI scores\\n41.68 ± 5.72\\n49 ± 5.63\\n0.00\\nTable 3\\nSurvey results of caregiver's opinions about patient's nutritional support.\\nCaregivers of stroke patients on PEG\\nCaregivers of orally fed stroke patients\\nP values\\n1.

In our two caregiver\\nsamples, the distribution of gender was very similar. The authors\\ndid not ﬁnd a correlation between the level of burden and the\\npsychological health and suggested that coping strategies and\\ncontrolling emotions might be responsible for this.\\nPEG is a minimally invasive and convenient procedure with low\\ncomplication rates [21]. PEG may provide reducing malnutrition\\nand sequelae and improving survival for patients with impaired\\noral intake. However, feeding via PEG takes time and impacts daily\\nroutine of caregivers. The study by Jukic et al. is unique for assessing\\nthe difﬁculties and satisfactions of caregivers assisting older pa-\\ntients with home enteral nutrition therapy [22]. The authors\\nexamined the experiences of caregivers who were not healthcare\\nprofessionals, who assisted old patients treated with enteral\\nnutrition, and identiﬁed caregivers' level of preparation, their\\nconcerns and needs. They reported that all participants testiﬁed the\\ninitial fear and refusal to manage the nutrition therapy and\\ninformal caregivers suffered from the limitation in their leisure\\ntime. By contrast, according to the results of research by Villar-Taibo\\net al., the intense burden was more frequent in oral over enteral\\nnutrition [23]. The researchers stated that the type of home artiﬁ-\\ncial nutrition may be a reason for caregiver's burden. In our study,\\nwe observed that caregivers of stroke patients on PEG found\\nfeeding with PEG secure and easy to use. Our ﬁndings support the\\nresults of Villar-Taibo et al.\\nIn spite of the importance of the impact of nutrition type in the\\nburden of caregivers of patients with stroke, there are currently no\\npublished studies regarding the assessment of levels of burden and\\nthe psychological distress toward caregivers of ischemic stroke\\npatients fed by PEG and orally. The strength of our study includes\\nthat we compared our results with two caregiver samples who\\nprovide different types of feeding for their patients. Besides this, we\\nevaluated the depressive symptoms among caregivers of stroke\\npatients and demonstrated that the type of feeding did not have\\ndirect effects on depression. The study was conducted in caregivers'\\nof ischemic stroke patients which led to identify characteristics of\\nburden and depression in a homogeneous group of participants.\\nThe questionnaire we developed helped us to explore family\\ncaregivers' experiences from their own perspectives. However, the\\nlack of validation of the questionnaire for the assessment of care-\\ngivers’ satisfaction of nutritional support therapy is one potential\\nlimitation of the current study.\\nIn conclusion, our ﬁndings support a beneﬁcial effect of feeding\\nwith PEG on caregiver's burden. To provide sufﬁcient nutritional\\ncare, PEG tube feeding offers a considerable medical beneﬁt in\\ncomparison with feeding orally. Further studies are needed to\\ndevelop guidelines for a home-based long-term care plan to help\\ncaregivers of patients with stroke.\\nFunding\\nWe don't have any ﬁnancial disclosures.

       " \"BACKGROUND\\nEvery year millions of patients who survive critical illness are faced\\nwith a new and complex set of consequences and challenges called\\nsurvivorship.1 Intensive care unit (ICU) survivors have to deal with a\\ndifferent version of themselves after ICU discharge, characterized by\\nall three adverse survivorship dimensions of physical function, cogni-\\ntive function and mental health status.2\\nReceived: 2 June 2023\\nRevised: 25 March 2024\\nAccepted: 27 March 2024\\nDOI: 10.1111/nicc.13077\\nNurs Crit Care. 2024;29:807–823.\\nwileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/nicc\\n© 2024 British Association of Critical Care Nurses.\\n807\\nMany ICU survivors do not return to their initial health status.3\\nIndeed, as described in the literature, many risk factors are signifi-\\ncantly associated with post-intensive care syndrome (PICS), such as\\nolder age,4 female gender,5 previous mental health problems4 and\\nspecific situations developed during the ICU stay, such as high disease\\nseverity,6 negative ICU experience,4 and delirium and its duration,7\\nwhich negatively impact quality of life (QoL).2,6 Authors observed that\\nICU survivors face different and wide sequelae after ICU discharge,8\\nwhich\\nare\\nidentified\\nas\\nthe\\nthree\\ndimensions\\nof\\nthe\\nPICS.\\nPsychological sequelae are common, such as depression, anxiety and\\npost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).9 Cognitive impairments such as\\ndifficulty with memory, concentration and attention are observed.10\\nAlso, physical consequences such as being exhausted, pain,8,11 muscu-\\nlar weakness12 and loss of appetite and weight13 are described.\\nThe three dimensions (physical, psychological and mental) charac-\\nterize the core properties of PICS.14 In 2021, Yuan et al. defined the\\nconcept of PICS as ‘new or worsening co-occurrence of physical dys-\\nfunctions, psychological disorders, cognitive impairments or failed\\nsocial reconstruction with these impairments persisting beyond ICU\\nand hospital discharge’.\\nThis definition of the syndrome thus expresses the need to iden-\\ntify all three dimensions in order to develop a more comprehensive\\nand holistic insight into PICS. In contrast, in 2020 Lee et al. found in\\ntheir meta-analysis that only one study15 reported on all three attri-\\nbutes of PICS.4 The reason may be because PICS has been discussed\\nfor a relatively short time.14\\nIn 2015, systematic reviews and meta-analyses were published\\nabout the impact of routine follow-up consultations on the anxiety,\\ndepression, PTSD and QoL of ICU survivors after discharge.16\\nThe fifth edition of the Diagnostic and statistical manual of men-\\ntal disorders (DSM-5™) defines anxiety, depression and PTSD.17 Anxi-\\nety\\nsymptoms\\ninclude\\nconditions\\nthat\\nshare\\ncharacteristics\\nof\\nelevated levels of fear or anxiety and related behavioural distur-\\nbances. Depressive symptoms refer to disruptive mood dysregulation\\ndisorder, while PTSD is a psychiatric disorder that develops in people\\nwho have experienced a traumatic event.17 This review considers all\\nthree PICS dimensions, but recent research by Yuan and colleagues18\\nreported that many authors chose and evaluated only a single domain\\nof PICS rather than evaluating PICS comprehensively. Furthermore,\\nthe authors showed that anxiety and depression could be detected by\\na single tool and later described as PICS without consideration of the\\ncognitive and physical dimensions.18\\nHowever, PICS affects not only the ICU survivors' health but also\\ntheir relatives' health. Family post-intensive care syndrome (PICS-F),\\nwhich encompasses the psychological and cognitive repercussions\\nthat ICU survivors' relatives suffer after the ICU stay, influences\\nQoL.2,6 This syndrome has been defined by the Society of Critical\\nCare Medicine (SCCM) to identify psychological distress experienced\\nby ICU family members during the post-ICU period, including symp-\\ntoms of anxiety, depression and PTSD,19–21 in view of family-centred\\ncare as an approach ‘that is respectful of and responsive to individual\\nfamilies' needs and values’. Furthermore, an essential aspect of care-\\ngiver research is determining the emotional burden described as\\nreduced functional status during daily activities and depression and\\nanxiety symptoms.22 Together with patient-centred care, it represents\\nthe crucial components of the quality of global care, as stated in 2001\\nby the Institute of Medicine Committee on Quality of Health Care in\\nAmerica.23 Indeed, family support in the ICU can improve survivors'\\noutcomes by allowing families to be relatives for all intents and\\npurposes.24\\nRenner explains the benefit of ICU diaries written by nurses or\\nfamily members to record events about the period that critically ill\\npatients usually cannot remember in a recent Guideline on multimodal\\nrehabilitation for patients with post-intensive care syndrome.25 In fol-\\nlow-up programs, critical care nurses manage the post-discharge\\nperiod by detecting the sequelae of PICS on ICU survivors and PICS-F\\non ICU relatives.16,26 Furthermore, the introduction of nurse-managed\\nICU diaries allows for reductions in the risks of anxiety, depressive\\nsymptoms and PTSD.25\\nAlthough several authors have focused their studies on analysing\\nthe effect of PICS on the health of ICU survivors27–29 and their rela-\\ntives,5 no systematic review has been conducted to summarize the\\nknowledge about the effect of PICS on both ICU survivors and their\\nrelatives. Indeed, to our knowledge, systematic reviews4,30 on PICS\\nhave been more focused on understanding the risk factors and less on\\nthe consequences, especially the multidimensional concept of the syn-\\ndrome. Furthermore, a recent systematic review was published about\\nthis topic; however, authors were more focused to investigate the\\ncharacteristics of existing instruments used to measure this syn-\\ndrome.18 To our knowledge, researchers have been focused more on\\nICU survivors than on their relatives.4,13 This represents a gap in the\\nliterature because knowing PICS, identified as a comprehensive three-\\ndimension syndrome, and its effects on both the QoL of ICU survivors\\nand their relatives will provide a different perspective to detect and\\nimplement tools and interventions aimed at these two populations.\\nWhat is known about the topic\\n• Post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) and post-intensive\\ncare syndrome-family (PICS-F) affect survivors and their\\nrelatives after critical illness survivorship.\\n• PICS is common after acute care admission in three\\ndomains: physical, mental and cognitive.\\n• PICS-F is characterized by psychological sequelae such as\\nanxiety and depression.\\nWhat this paper adds\\n• PICS was associated with poor quality of life in ICU survi-\\nvors and is explained predominantly by the mental\\ncomponent.\\n• The mental components of PICS, such as anxiety, depres-\\nsion and PTSD, adversely impact ICU survivors after\\ndischarge.\\n• Relatives who experience PICS-F report increased strain-\\nrelated symptoms and sleep disorders.\\n808\\nGRAVANTE ET AL.\\n14785153, 2024, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nicc.13077 by Aix-Marseille Universitaet, Wiley Online Library on [17/01/2026].

Furthermore, we investigate a\\nrelationship between PICS-F and their relatives ‘QoL, regardless of\\nwhether the patient displays PICS.\\nWe tested the following hypothesis:\\nPICS is associated with a negative impact on QoL in ICU survivors.\\nFurthermore, as described in the literature, PICS evaluation was mainly\\ninvestigated only in term of the mental component.18 We therefore\\nassume that the mental components of PICS, such as anxiety, depres-\\nsion and PTSD, negatively impact ICU survivors after discharge.\\nPICS-F was associated with a negative impact on ICU relatives\\n‘QoL’ after discharge.\\n2\\n|\\nDESIGN AND METHODS\\n2.1\\n|\\nDesign\\nThis systematic literature review was reported according to the Preferred\\nReporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA)31\\nand registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42022382123).\\n2.2\\n|\\nSearch strategy and research questions\\nA comprehensive bibliographic search was conducted on PubMed (via\\nMEDLINE), CINAHL (via EBSCO), Scopus and Web of Science\\n(via EBSCO) in March 2022. The search strategy included combina-\\ntions and synonyms of free text and MESH (medical subject headings)\\nterms. To identify additional studies, we also examined the reference\\nlists of retrieved articles.\\nWe included the search terms such as (family* OR caregiver* OR\\n‘care partner’ OR carer OR survivor OR dyad OR patient OR carere-\\nceiver) AND (‘intensive care unit’ OR ‘intensive care’ OR ‘critical\\ncare’ OR ICU) AND (‘post intensive care syndrome’ OR ‘post care\\nsyndrome’) AND (‘quality of Life’ OR QoL OR HRQoL OR ‘Health\\nRelated Quality of Life’ OR anxiety OR depression OR stress OR bur-\\nden OR ‘sleep disorder’ OR mutuality OR preparedness). The research\\nquestion was: How does the onset of post-intensive care syndrome and\\nfamily post-intensive care syndrome influence QoL in ICU survivors\\nand their ICU relatives?\\n2.3\\n|\\nStudy selection\\nWe included original studies with the following inclusion criteria:\\n(1) adult ICU survivors (> = 18 years old); (2) each outcome evaluation\\nwithin the mental component of PICS; (3) study design: cohort, case–\\ncontrol studies, cross-sectional studies, randomized control trials\\n(RCTs) and longitudinal studies.\\nRegarding ICU relatives, we included articles according to the fol-\\nlowing criteria: (1) adult relatives or family (> = 18 years old); (4) any\\noutcome evaluation within the dimensions of PICS-F; and (2) study\\ndesign: cohort, case–control studies, cross-sectional studies, random-\\nized control trials (RCTs) and longitudinal studies.\\nExclusion criteria were (1) studies that did not report the three\\ndimensions of PICS as an outcome variable; (2) study design: reviews;\\n(3) studies that had not been peer reviewed (e.g., abstract, report, edi-\\ntorial, and conference proceedings); and (4) studies not in English.\\nRegarding relatives, we excluded articles according to the follow-\\ning criteria: (1) studies that did not assess PICS-F as an outcome vari-\\nable; (2) study design: reviews; (3) studies that had not been peer\\nreviewed (e.g., abstract, report, editorial, conference proceedings); and\\n(4) studies not in English.

Also, authors applied the same valid\\nand reliable measures for all included studies.35–53\\nWe included 3106 ICU survivors and 279 relatives in this systematic\\nreview. The sample was composed predominantly of male survivors (over\\n60%) in 11 studies,37–41,43–46,49,50 with an average age above 60 in nine\\nstudies.36,38,40,43–45,48–50 Six studies reported results on survivors hospi-\\ntalized in a general ICU,46,36,47,37,41,48 four studies on a COVID\\nICU,41,42,44,45 and four studies on a medical/surgical ICU.39,40,43,49 One\\nstudy each was conducted on trauma ICU survivors,35 cardiac surgery\\nICU survivors,50 and mixed ICU survivors.38 Fifteen studies reported on\\nICU length of stay.35–39,41–50 Six studies attested that ICU length of stay\\nwas around 20 days,35,36,42,44,45,47 while six studies showed an ICU\\nlength of stay of <10 days.38,39,43,46,48,49 Seven studies measured ICU\\ndelirium during ICU stay.35,38,40,41,45,46,48 Four studies reported an ele-\\nvated prevalence of ICU delirium (up to 70%).35,40,45,46 Two studies\\nshowed that ICU survivors with acute respiratory failure were between\\n74% and 85.7%.35,47 An increasing number of survivors (up to 89%) were\\nmechanically ventilated in four studies.40,44,45,48 Two COVID ICU survi-\\nvor studies showed that around 30% of ICU survivors were nursed in a\\nprone position during the ICU stay.41,45 Three studies51–53 showed that\\nrelatives were predominantly women aged 55, while two studies51,52\\nreported that 33% were a spouse. Five studies were conducted in the\\nUnited States,36,40–42,45 three in Japan,38,43,48 two in Australia,37,47 and\\none each in Sweden,46 Portugal,49 Belgium,44 the Netherlands,39 and\\nScotland.50\\n3.3\\n|\\nQuality of life in ICU survivors\\nOf the 19 included studies, 10 studies reported on QoL in ICU survi-\\nvors with PICS.36–39,41–44,47,50 Thirty-seven percent of ICU survivors\\nwere affected in more than one domain, and 73% had sequelae after\\none year, as Farley and Henderson reported.47,50 The mental compo-\\nnent of PICS negatively affected the QoL of ICU survivors.38,39,43 A\\nmore substantial home rehabilitation setting was associated with\\nincreased QoL (p = .008).36\\nQoL was affected by PICS on different domains. QoL issues var-\\nied across different time points post-ICU discharge, with fluctuations\\nin mobility – moderate impairment 8% of ICU survivors after\\n3 months, 18% after 12 months.37,41,44,50 Self-care issues were\\nreported to be 6% after 3 months, and to be increased to 15% after\\n12 months.39 Pain and discomfort were reported as moderate impair-\\nment at 13% after 3 months and increased to 27% after 12 months.37\\nAnxiety and depression were reported in 18% of the ICU survivors\\nafter 12 months.36\\nMorelli et al. reported no statistically significant differences in the\\nQoL of ICU survivors from COVID-19.42 Two studies attested to\\nmoderate and high levels of disability in ICU survivors with a PICS\\ncomponent,40,41 and one reported a high prevalence of sleep disorder\\n(75%)44 (Table 1).\\n3.4\\n|\\nPICS and anxiety, depression and PTSD of\\nICU survivors\\nPICS is prevalent in ICU survivors at 43% to 96%.35,36,40,45,49 Five\\nstudies reported PICS prevalence in three domains.35,36,38,40,46 The\\nmost prevalent domain was physical impairment.35,36 Bottom-Tanzer\\net al. showed that 92.9% (n = 65) of ICU survivors had a physical\\nimpairment, while Dubin et al. attested to 80% (n = 40) of cases.35,36\\nCognitive impairment was described in four studies.

Our main findings were (1) mobility, pain, dis-\\ncomfort and disability as the domains of QoL most affected by PICS in\\nICU survivors; (2) the mental component of PICS negatively affects\\nthe QoL of ICU survivors; (3) a high prevalence of PICS and moderate\\nprevalence of PICS-F and (4) strain-related symptoms and sleep\\ndisorders as the most affected dimensions by PICS-F in ICU family\\nmembers.\\nRelevant differences in QoL domains such as mobility, pain, dis-\\ncomfort and disability were observed among the ICU survivors with\\nPICS. In 2017, Hodgson and colleagues reported a moderate or severe\\ndisability in survivors of critical illness.15 Similar results were obtained\\nin our review. In the literature, it is described how long periods of\\nimmobility can negatively affect disability after ICU discharge.15 Inter-\\nestingly, the predictors of disability included a history of anxiety/\\ndepression.15 This review focuses on the three dimensions of PICS,\\nbut the psychological sequelae are described in the literature as PICS\\nwithout considering the cognitive and physical domains.18\\nIn 2017, Makinen and colleagues reported a high prevalence of\\npersistent pain in ICU survivors.54 The same result was described in\\nour review.\\nOur review shows that the mental component of PICS nega-\\ntively affects the QoL of ICU survivors. As the literature describes,\\npatients with severe mental health problems have a lower quality of\\nlife than the general population.55,56 Patients with mental health\\nproblems find it harder to accomplish many of their daily chores,\\nsuch as washing and dressing, reducing self-confidence.56 In 2020,\\nBerghöfer and colleagues assessed QoL in patients with severe men-\\ntal illness.56 The authors observed that patients with anxiety disor-\\nders and depressive symptoms reported lower Qol scores.56 Similar\\nfindings were obtained in the studies included in the review.38,39,43\\nGuideline on multimodal rehabilitation for patients with post-inten-\\nsive care syndrome by Renner reported that psychological interven-\\ntions, such as ICU diary, can counteract PICS's psychological\\nsequelae such as anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress.25\\nICU diaries are essential non-pharmacological interventions written\\nby nurses, therapists, or family members to record events about the\\nperiod that critically ill patients usually cannot remember.57\\nOur results showed that the PICS prevalence lies in an extensive\\nrange between 43% and 96%. The studies in our review included ICU\\nsurvivors discharged from different types of ICUs with varying admis-\\nsions to the ICU. A recent systematic review describes that ICU\\nadmissions, such as emergency admission and ICU type, are consid-\\nered risk factors for the onset of PICS symptoms.4\\nIndeed, the ICU survivors discharged from general and medical/\\nsurgical ICUs have a PICS prevalence between 43% and 54%.36,40,49\\nThat percentage has a sharp increase in those ICU survivors dis-\\ncharged from COVID-19 ICUs (90%),45 with a further rise in ICU sur-\\nvivors discharged from trauma ICUs (96%).35 A recent systematic\\nreview with meta-analysis describes that negative ICU experience and\\ndelirium are important risk factors for the onset of PICS.4 Our result\\nshowed an extensive range of prevalence of PICS. Furthermore, Bot-\\ntom-Tanzer et al. reported a high prevalence of ICU delirium (pre-\\nvalence = 81%)35 compared with other studies, including those which\\nmeasure ICU delirium. Moreover, the severity of critical illness\\nappears to be an independent risk factor for the onset of ICU delir-\\nium.58,59 Six out of 19 studies measured ICU delirium. Bottom-Tanzer\\net al. found the highest range in the survey, with a higher prevalence\\nof PICS than in other included studies. Bottom-Tanzer et al. did not\\nstudy the relationship between PICS and ICU delirium, but we\\nhypothesize that it may have influenced onset. Therefore, future\\nresearch should describe how these phenomena interact with each\\nother and ICU survivors’ outcomes.\\nThe prevalence of PICS symptoms varies depending on the areas\\ninvolved, such as cognitive, physical and mental status. ICU survivors\\nwith PICS may develop impairment in one or more domains. Bottom-\\nTanzer et al. reported that in trauma ICU survivors, PICS developed in\\n34.4% (n = 24) with one criterion. At the same time, it decreased\\namong ICU survivors with two or more standards,35 in COVID-19 sur-\\nvivors, this result increased by up to 90%.41,42\\nCognitive impairment was a key component of PICS and was\\nreferred to as a more permanent condition60,61 in ICU survivors. Sev-\\neral studies in our systematic review showed a correlation between\\ncognitive impairment and anxiety, depression and PTSD.35,38,46 Criti-\\ncal illness and intensive care treatment are associated with long-term\\ncognitive impairment.11 This decline could cause significant problems\\nin survivors' daily life and professional settings, such as memory, visual\\nconstruction, processing speed and executive functioning.62 Further-\\nmore, ICU patients experiencing anxiety and depression need more\\nintensive health care than usual to accomplish activities of daily liv-\\ning.63 In 2022, Smith and Rahman observed that these sensations\\nwere increased by feelings of isolation, fear and dehumanization,\\nwhich would justify the relationship with the psychiatric sequelae of\\nthe PICS area after discharge.64\\nA fundamental component for reducing PICS is the introduction\\nof family members in the care process of ICU survivors.49 Further-\\nmore, ICU relatives will experience various burdens attributable to\\nPICS-F.19 Several family members who provided care for critically ill\\nsurvivors report that it was somewhat difficult to pay for basic needs\\nsuch as food, housing, medical care and heating, thus creating anxiety\\nand depression.65,66\\nOur results show that ICU relatives experienced sleep disorders\\nwith PICS-F. Previous studies described that relatives with sleep dis-\\norders had moderate to severe depression and anxiety.26 The cause\\ncould be the patient's concern about vigilance activity during the\\nnight, which caused some anxiety.22,67 In 2003, Mahoney defined vig-\\nilance as the continuous supervision by relatives of their patients'\\nactivities.67 This activity consists of five phases: supervision, protec-\\ntive intervening, anticipating, always on duty and being there.67 Vigi-\\nlant relatives considered themselves ‘on duty’ even when they\\nweren't ‘doing stuff’, explaining the moderate to severe depression\\nand anxiety among relatives.67\\nGRAVANTE ET AL.\\n819\\n14785153, 2024, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nicc.13077 by Aix-Marseille Universitaet, Wiley Online Library on [17/01/2026].

Several factors can negatively impact the QoL by\\ncreating dependence in daily activities, such as older age, male sex,\\nICU delirium, illness severity and duration of mechanical ventilation.68\\nICU admission is an experience that makes a difference to\\npatients. Some ICU survivors have fragmented memories; others\\nremembered the darkness, were unable to speak and had a severe ill-\\nness and could not get out of bed.69 Memories are foundational to\\nour experience and can often be influenced by ICU survivors.70\\nRecently, Cohen and Kahana developed a theory on how episodic\\nmemory patterns re-establish themselves from context, and memories\\nform associations with the contexts in which they are encoded,\\nincluding emotional valence and arousal.71\\nAcute care admission is a period that significantly impacts survi-\\nvors and family members. Feeling useless when the death of a family\\nmember could become a real possibility is one of the feelings that rel-\\natives of ICU survivors experience.69\\nThe quality assessment of the included studies was good. Only\\none study scored low, while most of the included studies scored over\\n70%, confirming good methodological quality. Recently, Wang et al.\\nand Jeong et al. developed specific tools for detecting PICS, but we\\nare unaware of any tools for PICS-F.8,10\\n4.1\\n|\\nLimitations\\nThis review has several limitations. Our results were based on studies\\nnot using a specific PICS or PICS-F detection tool. In 2010, the SCCM\\ndefined PICS as new impairments in ICU survivors in the physical,\\ncognitive and mental components.21 PICS was detected according to\\nthe SCCM model, detecting the ICU survivors' central disturbances.21\\nThe researcher detected each disorder with a specific scale, but the\\nlong-term outcomes of ICU survivors are numerous. Even though we\\nused a rigorous search and screening strategy, considering that the\\ndefinition of PICS encompasses extensive domains, our search strat-\\negy may not have detected all related studies. Furthermore, we pur-\\nposely focused only on the mental component of PICS because we\\nwere interested in evaluating mental aspects underestimated in ICU\\nsurvivors and their relatives, providing a vision of the humanization of\\nafter-discharge care. Given the clinical complexity of the survivors,\\nnot all are detectable, leading to bias.36 In addition, the tools used\\nwere not always specific to ICU survivors. Another limitation is that\\nwe could consider observational studies only, except for one RCT.\\nThis is probably because the topic is relatively new in the literature,\\nespecially with respect to the relatives of the ICU survivors. Indeed,\\nonly five studies on PICS-F were identified in this systematic review.\\nTherefore, few RCTs studied interventions aimed at these two popu-\\nlations.53 The review exclusion criteria restricting the studies to those\\nin English only and the lack of meta-analysis are limitations.\\n4.2\\n|\\nImplications for practice and further research\\nThis review has several implications. The literature describes the\\napproaches to minimize PICS and PICS-F.72 The PICS clinic is an environ-\\nment where critical care survivors are assessed through a psychiatric\\nassessment, including self-assessment modules to test physical, cognitive\\nand mental symptoms.35 PICS and PICS-F are serious and outstanding\\nissues that strongly impact cost and are measured in terms of time for\\ndisability, health care costs, financial stress, mortality and potentially pre-\\nventable readmission.73,74 Specific tools for detecting PICS would pro-\\nvide a more accurate estimate of the phenomenon, helping nurses to\\nidentify the ICU survivors who need treatment. Future research is\\nexpected to focus on using standardized tools to detect PICS and PICS-F\\nin specific environments, such as PICS clinics, as a common activity for\\ncritical care nurses. Critical care nurses are essential in developing and\\nimplementing follow-up treatments. They play leadership, staffing and\\ndeveloping roles in different post-ICU services.26 As per Renner et al.,25\\nthe latest PICS rehabilitation guidelines state that professional support is\\nneeded during the follow-up care; in particular, the role of nurses in ICU\\nis fundamental in writing and reading along with survivors and their rela-\\ntives the ICU diaries, as part of the aftercare treatment, in order to obtain\\nbetter outcomes such as deeper comprehension of the ICU stay, effec-\\ntive coping, improvement of social relationships. Specific tools for detect-\\ning PICS would provide a more accurate estimate of the syndrome,\\nhelping nurses to identify the ICU survivors who need treatment. Fur-\\nthermore, because so little has been found on PICS-F and ICU relatives,\\nfuture research is expected to focus on this population as there is a gap\\nin literature about the identification of this phenomenon through proper\\ntools; also, there are very few interventions towards this population as\\nonly one RCT has been found.53 Finally, more research is needed on\\nusing standardized tools to detect PICS and PICS-F in specific environ-\\nments, such as PICS clinics, as a common activity for critical care nurses.\\n5\\n|\\nCONCLUSION\\nPICS and PICS-F are common multidimensional cognitive, physical and\\nmental phenomena. The authors investigated each PICS area separately\\nfrom the others, and not all areas were investigated in some studies.\\nFuture studies should focus on standardized tools that detect PICS and\\nPICS-F in all areas. They are often associated with elevated levels of\\nanxiety and depression. In contrast, an increased anxiety level in ICU\\nsurvivors is associated with increased anxiety in family members, who\\nexperience strain-related symptoms and sleep disorders. Early recogni-\\ntion and timely identification of these syndromes must be guaranteed\\nby nurses, by enforcing multidisciplinary follow-up post-ICU services,\\nwhere critical care nurses can develop and implement specific interven-\\ntions, in order to improve survivors’ and relatives’ outcomes.\\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\\nData curation (lead), formal analysis (lead), investigation (lead),\\nwriting – original draft preparation (lead), writing – review and editing\\n(lead): Francesco Gravante.

The\\npractice of palliative care in the ED may decrease patients’ symptom burden, improve access\\nto needed services, reduce hospital length of stay, enhance care at the end of life, decrease\\nthe number of undesired ICU admissions, and orchestrate psychosocial support for the\\nfamily [2, 3]. Goals-of-care conversations (GOCC), which explore a patient’s quality of life,\\nviews, and priorities within the context of medical treatment, may increase the likelihood\\nthat a patient’s end-of-life care preferences are known and followed [4].\\nMost of the work involving palliative care in the ED involves older adults with preexisting\\nlife-limiting conditions, such as incurable cancer [5]. Less is known about the impact of\\nearly palliative care for patients with severe acute brain injury (SABI), including stroke,\\ntraumatic brain injury (TBI), and hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy after cardiac arrest.\\nPatients with SABI face a sudden threat to their life and personhood [6] and a high\\ndegree of prognostic uncertainty in terms of morbidity and mortality, especially in the\\nhyperacute setting [7-9]. Many of these patients, or more accurately their family members,\\nin the ED are immediately confronted with choices regarding intubation, cardiopulmonary\\nresuscitation (CPR), endovascular thrombectomy, decompressive hemicraniectomy, or\\ninvasive intracranial pressure monitoring. These are complex medical decisions that must\\nbe made in a short amount of time and often involve additional intricacies, such as transfers\\nto larger academic centers or admissions to a neuro-ICU.\\nFor the last decade, there has been an increased focus on the integration of palliative care\\ninto the practice of neurology [10, 11]. The “neuropalliative care approach,” recognizes\\nthe unique palliative care needs of patients with neurologic disease and their families. This\\nmultidisciplinary, multidimensional approach to symptom relief, psychosocial support, and\\nend-of-life care can be applied to patients with neurological illness presenting to the ED\\n(Table 1). We describe three different roles that emergency medicine (EM) clinicians are\\nuniquely poised to fill in order to provide comprehensive primary neuropalliative care to\\npatients that starts in the ED: the stage setter, the spokesperson, and the screener (Table 2).\\nThis review serves two purposes: (1) to describe roles for EM clinicians and (2) to provide\\ncontext for neuro-ICU clinicians about what neuropalliative care their patients may receive\\nprior to arriving to the neuro-ICU and how the practice of neuropalliative care beginning in\\nthe ED ultimately benefits their patients.\\nThe Stage Setter\\nThe role of the stage setter is to prepare the family for what is ahead by having an initial\\nGOCC. When a patient presents with SABI, EM clinicians are typically the first to talk\\nwith and “break bad news” to the patient’s family members. In this role, EM clinicians take\\non a large responsibility as they start establishing trust and expectations with the family.\\nFortunately, there are established frameworks for breaking bad news, such as the SPIKES\\nprotocol [12], the ABCDE mnemonic [13], and the use of a “headline” [14], which can\\nhelp guide the stage setter. Regardless of the model that is used, the general message to the\\nfamily is that their loved one suffered a brain injury and their hospitalization will likely be\\nlong, with an expected level of recovery that is uncertain. Messaging also aims to orient\\nHendershot and Ouchi\\nPage 2\\nNeurocrit Care. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2025 October 03.\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nthe families to the unique aspects of neurocritical illness, such as prognostic uncertainty,\\nunpredictable nature of an ICU course, involvement of multiple health care teams, and\\nroles of supportive care resources (e.g., palliative care, social work, and spiritual care).\\nThe language used by EM clinicians to convey the patient’s condition to the family can\\nbe passed along to the neuro-ICU clinicians so that they may be able to use the same\\nphrasing or course correct as needed. Use of consistent language may enhance the family’s\\nunderstanding of the patient’s condition and also demonstrates seamless care transitions\\nfrom the ED to the ICU.\\n“Setting the stage” also includes encouraging family members to begin formulating the\\npatient’s values and preferences and how their past experiences may relate to their current\\nsituation without discussing the patient’s prognosis. In older adults, collecting information\\nregarding their baseline physical and cognitive function, as well as perceived quality of life,\\nis especially important. Older adult ICU survivors experience a significant decline in their\\nfunctional status over the year following their admission, especially if they already had an\\nimpaired functional baseline [15]. Although sharing a prognosis is ideally avoided in the\\nED, experts suggest that if clinicians discuss prognosis with a patient’s family members, it\\nis important to acknowledge the uncertainty associated with SABI [16]. Guidelines recently\\npublished by the Neurocritical Care Society regarding neuroprognostication for patients in\\na coma following cardiac arrest [7] or critically ill from an intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH)\\n[8] or moderate and severe TBI [9] recommend not beginning to assess prognostic factors\\nfor at least 72 h after the injury. All three guidelines endorse the use of all indicated medical\\nand surgical interventions within this time frame, unless the patient is imminently dying\\nfrom their injury or they have clear documentation stating they do not want to receive any\\nlife-prolonging interventions [7-9].\\nTherefore, we recommend that the focus of this initial GOCC not be on making any\\nlarge immediate decisions regarding withholding/withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment\\n(WWLST), including CPR, unless clear and well-established goals to focus on comfort-\\ndirected care already exist. Given this recommendation, we also advise against hospital\\npolicies that require EM clinicians to establish code status prior to admitting the patient,\\nas the prognostic uncertainty of neurological emergencies often makes this consistent\\npractice inappropriate. When having GOCC, EM clinicians tend to be more focused\\non asking for preferences regarding specific procedures, such as intubation and CPR,\\npotentially misleading patients/surrogates rather than first eliciting a patient’s values and\\nthen developing a treatment plan that best aligns with the patient’s preferences [17]. The\\nperceived length of time required to explore a patient’s values was reported as a potential\\nbarrier to a preference-based GOCC in the ED [18]. We do not expect that the entire\\nconversation can be completed in the ED and are instead advocating that EM clinicians\\nsimply start the preferences-based conversation with the patient’s family members in order\\nto encourage them to think about the patient’s qualities and prepare them for their continued\\nconversations with the neuro-ICU, neurology, and neurosurgical teams. By initiating the\\nGOCC, EM clinicians will allow neuro-ICU clinicians to demonstrate the understanding of\\npatients’ baseline function, perceived quality of life, and values and goals for medical care\\nelicited by EM clinicians. By seamlessly continuing the GOCC, family members will feel\\nheard and understood from the first day of their neuro-ICU stay.\\nHendershot and Ouchi\\nPage 3\\nNeurocrit Care. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2025 October 03.\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAs the stage setter, the EM clinicians can provide emotional support to the surrogates.\\nFamily members face several unique psychosocial challenges, such as coming to terms with\\nthe significant prognostic uncertainty; unaddressed physical needs, such as housing and\\nfood; and a lack of consistent compassion, communication, and messaging from their health\\ncare team [19]. Social workers and spiritual care providers can supply the families with\\ntheir invaluable resources and insights. Providing initial support will help establish a strong\\nrelationship between the clinicians and the surrogates. It is critical that any psychosocial\\nneeds of the family that are identified in the ED be passed on to the neuro-ICU team to\\naddress these needs up front in the neuro-ICU.\\nFinally, although the stage setter has the opportunity to develop trust between the health\\ncare team and the family, it is also important to note there is a risk of creating irreversible\\ndistrust. This can occur by providing misinformation regarding the patient’s prognosis,\\nbeing overly adamant about obtaining a patient’s code status, offering or withholding\\ntreatment options that would be better introduced by other clinicians (such as the placement\\nof an external ventricular drain or the initiation of hemodialysis), or insisting on continuing\\nthe GOCC with family members who are highly distressed after the “breaking bad news”\\nportion of the conversation. It is important for the EM clinicians to be candid about any\\ntension that may have arisen between the EM team and the family so that the neuro-ICU\\nteam knows what to specifically address in an attempt to rebuild any lost trust. Therefore,\\nthe role of stage setter is a large responsibility that would demand specific training in\\nprimary palliative care and communication skills in every EM residency.\\nThe Spokesperson\\nAs the patient’s spokesperson, EM clinicians are responsible for advocating guideline- and\\ngoal-concordant care while preventing underuse or overuse of LST. Overly pessimistic\\nneuroprognostication may result in LST not being offered or declined by the patient or\\nfamily members and may lead to potential underuse of LST [20]. Conversely, for patients\\nfor whom LST, within the context of an uncertain prognosis, is clearly not within their GOC\\nbased on previously stated or documented directives, admission to the neuro-ICU or transfer\\nto a tertiary care center may be inappropriate (i.e., potential overuse) [20]. To succeed in this\\nrole, EM clinicians must be aware of the factors and biases that affect the decision to pursue\\nthe initiation of LST, continuation of LST, or WWLST [20].\\nAs stated previously, current neuroprognostication guidelines for patients with SABI\\nrecommend that all interventions be pursued in the acute phase of injury, unless the\\ntreatments are inconsistent with the patient’s previously stated goals [7-9]. However, the\\ndecision to WWLST in the ED has been justified for a variety of medical reasons, such\\nas a lack of improvement following initial treatment, a belief that the patient’s injury\\nis irreversible, or an expected level of recovery that is not consistent with the patient’s\\nminimally acceptable quality of life [21, 22]. The use of a medical justification for the\\nWWLST of patients with SABI would ideally be avoided in the ED, as there is too much\\nprognostic uncertainty in the hyperacute setting. Instead, we recommend that in the role\\nof spokesperson, the EM clinicians advocate for guideline-concordant care, after gathering\\nrelevant information from the family, and make a recommendation regarding the use of\\nHendershot and Ouchi\\nPage 4\\nNeurocrit Care. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2025 October 03.\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nfurther LST within the context of the patient’s stated goals in conjunction with the neuro-\\nICU, neurosurgical, and neurology clinicians. In fact, if a medical justification is being used\\nfor the decision to WWLST in the ED, it is appropriate for EM clinicians to advocate for\\na multidisciplinary team huddle prior to speaking to the patient’s family about a treatment\\nplan.\\nOne approach to offering this initial treatment plan and preventing the underuse of LST\\nwhen the patient’s prognosis or values are uncertain is to introduce the concept of a time-\\nlimited trial (TLT) of LST [23, 24]. Although initiating a TLT is traditionally considered the\\nICU clinicians’ responsibility, introducing the concept of a TLT in the ED is an important\\ntool for the spokesperson to combat their own bias, and that of their consultants, to be\\ninfluenced by a premature neuroprognostication. By introducing a TLT in the ED, EM\\nclinicians can help set the expectations with the family and allow them to formulate their\\nGOC while the TLT is occurring. EM clinicians can take the following precautions when\\nintroducing the concept of a TLT: clearly communicate prognostic uncertainty to the family\\nand that a range of outcomes are possible, which the intensivists will further clarify, and\\ndefer to the ICU team regarding the discussion of indicators of clinical improvement\\nand deterioration and regarding the time frame for rediscussing GOC after arrival to the\\nICU. Furthermore, given the complexity of these treatment decisions, any initiation of a\\nTLT is best with a team approach consisting of bidirectional communication among the\\nmultidisciplinary team of EM, neuro-ICU, neurology, and neurosurgery clinicians. As they\\nwill be the team providing the continued care, it is best if the neuro-ICU team is present for\\nthe conversation introducing the concept of a TLT to the family so that there is continuity for\\nthe plan to be in place. A high-level of collaboration might not be available for every patient\\nin the ED. However, we propose it as a goal when considering a TLT. Introducing a TLT\\nmay also be appropriate for some patients whose overall goal is comfort-focused but who\\nhave a potentially reversible condition. For example, it may be appropriate to temporarily\\nreverse a patient’s DNI code status and intubate them for endovascular thrombectomy if\\nthere is a chance to decrease or eliminate the degree of disability the patient will experience\\n[25]. Others have suggested that in cases in which the patient’s values and preferences are\\nunclear, the provision of potentially unwanted aggressive care may be ethically justified\\nin some emergency or ICU settings, as long as it is provided with a clear offer of a TLT\\nand continued, skillful conversation [26]. For example, if a patient with a TBI is unable\\nto participate in a GOCC due to their injuries and no family members are identified, it is\\nlikely appropriate to proceed with a decompressive hemicraniectomy to prevent herniation\\nuntil a GOCC can occur. As illustrated by the examples in this paragraph, TLTs introduced\\nin the ED acknowledge prognostic uncertainty and the fluidity of a patient’s GOC in\\nthe hyperacute setting and allow for both aspects to evolve as a patient’s clinical picture\\nbecomes clearer. This is an ongoing area of research [23].\\nIn the opposite aspect of the spokesperson role, EM clinicians can also prevent the overuse\\nof LST by advocating for the avoidance of procedures, treatments, admissions, and transfers\\nfor patients in whom pursuing LST would not be within their GOC, even if prognostic\\nuncertainty exists. Patients with SABI are often transferred to larger academic centers\\nfor further evaluation or definitive treatment of their condition. However, a transfer to\\nanother care facility may not be within a patient’s GOC and could potentially be separating\\nHendershot and Ouchi\\nPage 5\\nNeurocrit Care. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2025 October 03.\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\na critically ill patient from their family members. Therefore, initiating such a transfer\\nwill ideally include a GOCC in order to determine that the procedure that the patient is\\npotentially being transferred for or the transfer itself is within the patient’s stated GOC.\\nA retrospective study of patients who died within 72 h of transfer to a large tertiary care\\ncenter found that only 10% of patients had a documented GOCC prior to being transferred\\n[27]. When having this conversation, it is important to note that not all patients who are\\ntransferred for higher levels of care receive an intervention and that not all patients benefit\\nfrom being transferred [28]. Informing the patient and/or their family members that, in some\\ncases, the transfer is just for further evaluation and for help formulating a prognosis is\\nalso important, as families may not want a transfer for those reasons and may not require\\nfurther clarity on the patient’s prognosis to make treatment decisions. As with any LST,\\na transfer to a tertiary care center provides the patient with a chance for improvement\\nthat they may otherwise not get and may still end with a comfort-focused pathway if the\\ndesired outcome is not achieved [29]. Presenting the transfer to the decision maker in a\\ncomprehensive manner, including the downstream effects of the transfer, has the potential\\nto prevent transfers that are not consistent with patient preferences and could save the\\nfamily significant emotional and economic distress, in addition to ensuring that the patient\\nis receiving goal-concordant care. One recommendation would be for accepting neuro-ICU\\nclinicians to ask the referring EM clinician if a preliminary GOCC has occurred and if they\\nbelieve the transfer is concordant with their treatment preferences.\\nThe Screener\\nWhereas the stage setter and spokesperson roles are more applicable to patients presenting\\nto the ED acutely with a life-threatening neurological illness, the screener is suggested as\\na role for EM clinicians to assess the neuropalliative care needs of all patients presenting\\nto the ED. As much of this review has focused on patients with SABI, we will discuss\\nthe screener role as it pertains to stable patients who are at risk of presenting to the ED\\nin extremis in the future. In this distinctive role, EM clinicians are the assessors of gaps\\nin the neuropalliative care needs of patients with neurodegenerative diseases and patients\\nwith medical histories, such as prior strokes or epilepsy, that put them at risk of acute\\nneurological decompensation in the future. For the first part of this role, EM clinicians can\\nscreen patients for ongoing neuropalliative care needs in relation to gaps in addressing their\\nGOC, pain, nutritional, and functional status during brief conversations initiated through\\nthe use of serious illness conversation triggers. Subsequently, they can make immediate\\nmedication adjustments or a referral to their outpatient clinician, as appropriate. For the\\nsecond part of the role, the intention is to elicit the values, preferences, and treatment\\ngoals of patients who have survived severe neurological emergencies to share their insights\\nregarding their future care if their condition were to recur or a new emergency were to\\ndevelop. It may be important to have this conversation documented before the patient is in\\na situation in which they are incapacitated, but knowledge of that information is paramount.\\nIn general, the screener plays a supportive role to the patient’s primary care physician or to\\nthe patient’s primary neurologist by ensuring that any gaps in the patient’s neuropalliative\\ncare have been addressed. Ideally, EM clinicians are building off prior conversations and\\nmanagement that the patient has had with their primary clinicians. However, as patients\\nHendershot and Ouchi\\nPage 6\\nNeurocrit Care. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2025 October 03.\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nwith chronic serious neurologic illness frequently present to the ED for management of their\\nchronic conditions, the need for this role is likely increasing.\\nPatients with neurodegenerative disorders are at risk of being functionally dependent as\\ntheir disease progresses but have low rates of documented GOCC [30]. Additionally, one\\nretrospective study of health system administrative data found that nearly two thirds of\\npatients with a neurodegenerative disease had at least one ED visit in the last year of\\ntheir life [31]. Patients with chronic neurological conditions presenting to the ED for pain,\\nnutritional problems, or gait instability are often better treated on an outpatient basis [32],\\nassuming that the patient has the ability to follow up with a clinician. There is a potential\\nneed and opportunity for EM clinicians to address gaps in patients’ GOCC and symptom\\nmanagement related to their neurodegenerative disease as they near the end of life. In the\\nscreener role, EM clinicians will identify serious illness conversation triggers in order to\\ninitiate a discussion that reveals the patient’s neuropalliative care needs. Although these\\ntriggers will need to be defined for the practice of neuropalliative care in the ED, several\\nhave been suggested for the general practice of neuropalliative care [33]. Events such as\\nnumerous hospitalizations; new weight loss and comorbidities; and changes in cognitive,\\nmobility, and functional status have been proposed as potential triggers [34]. Research is\\nneeded in order to establish serious illness conversation triggers specific to patients at risk of\\nand with neurological emergencies as well as steps to meet the identified needs.\\nAn additional opportunity for the screener exists with patients who have a medical history\\nof stroke or other conditions that put them at risk of presenting to the ED with a neurologic\\nemergency requiring neuro-ICU admission in the future. Each year, approximately 185,000\\npatients experience recurrent strokes [35]. When patients present with a recurrent stroke,\\nthey may be too incapacitated to express their treatment preferences. These patients may\\nalso have invaluable insights regarding their future care based on prior hospitalizations.\\nDespite the importance of GOCC with this patient group, less than half of stroke survivors\\npresenting to the stroke clinic had completed advance directives and even less had EMS\\ndocumentation of these directives in one single-center study [36]. Although three quarters\\nof the patients had some form of GOCC, more than half preferred to have additional\\ndialogue [36]. Therefore, for this group of patients, we propose the use of a serious illness\\nconversation trigger based on their medical history, such as stroke, seizures, progressive\\nneurologic disease, or frequent falls. For instance, upon admitting or discharging a patient\\nwith frequent presentations for seizures, the EM clinician can ask the patient about their\\npreferences and values that may be applicable to a decision to intubate the patient if any\\nof their future presentations warranted such an intervention. Successful screeners have the\\npotential to provide patients with the end-of-life care that they prefer by ensuring that their\\nvalues and preferences are clearly documented in the chart before the patient presents for a\\nlife-threatening condition. Therefore, the neuro-ICU clinicians could use this information in\\nthe future to develop a patient-centered, goal-concordant treatment plan for the patient. More\\nresearch is needed to determine whether fulfillment of this role is feasible for EM clinicians\\ngiven the time constraints often present in the ED.\\nHendershot and Ouchi\\nPage 7\\nNeurocrit Care.

Its\\nsuccessful integration may ease the transition for patients to the neuro-ICU. In an effort\\nto encourage EM clinicians to practice primary neuropalliative care, we have described\\nthree succinct roles: the stage setter, the spokesperson, and the screener. By combining\\nthe aspects of these three distinct roles, EM clinicians can help establish trust between\\nthe family members of patients and their care team, advocate against the underuse of LST\\nin situations of inappropriately premature neuroprognostication and against the overuse of\\nLST in situations in which the patient has clear directives contrary to the use of LST, and\\naddress the gaps in the management of patients with neuropalliative care needs who present\\nto the ED. As communication between EM clinicians and the inpatient teams is paramount\\nto each role, systems, such as sections in the written documentation or verbal handoff that\\nare dedicated to the discussion of GOCC, need to be established for these three proposed\\nframeworks to be successful. The practice of neuropalliative care in the ED requires further\\ninvestigation before targeted interventions, perhaps incorporating the three roles outlined\\nhere, can be developed.',\n",
       " 'Dying in the Intensive Care Unit: A Candle\\nVigil Using Illustrations\\nElizabeth K.N. Johnson, RN, BSN, and Eelco F.M. Wijdicks, MD, PhD\\nAbstract\\nWith death and dying in intensive care units, there should be bereavement support for families. We\\npropose placing an illustration of a candle on the door of an unresponsive dying patient, with additional\\nillustrations of votive candles at the nurses’ station opposite to the door as a neutral way of identifying\\nthese rooms with patients who transitioned to comfort care or who have died. The candle illustrations\\nencourage staff members to modify their words, silence themselves, and reﬂect. After a 1-year tryout in the\\nneurointensive care unit with a strong positive experience for staff and families, it can be perceived as a\\nsymbol of tranquility.\\nn Mayo Clin Proc Inn Qual Out 2018;2(4):378-381\\nT\\nhe staff of intensive care units (ICUs)\\nrecurrently deal with death and dying,\\nbut families bear the heavy burden.\\nThis realization has led medical institutions\\nto develop bereavement-support programs\\nfor families. The common occurrence of unex-\\npected sudden death from catastrophic brain\\ninjury is heartbreaking for all involved and\\nmakes effective bereavement support essential\\nin\\nneurointensive\\ncare\\nunits.1,2\\nIn\\nfact,\\nbereavement-associated posttraumatic stress\\ndisorder occurs more frequently in families\\nof patients who die in the ICU and, according\\nto studies performed in the neurointensive\\ncare unit, persists up to 6 months in 30% of\\nfamily members who participated in decision\\nmaking.3\\nWithin the room of the unresponsive pa-\\ntient, bereavement support involves agreed-\\nupon spiritual ceremonials and guidance. But\\noutside the patient room, the only visible\\ndisplay may be a closed curtain, a do-not-\\nenter (stop) sign when the patient has died,\\nor just a verbal admonition by a staff nurse―\\nnot infrequently at the last moment.\\nMotivated by an imperative to do better,\\nwe propose placing an illustration of a candle\\non the door of an unresponsive, dying patient,\\nwith additional illustrations of candles at the\\nnurses’ station opposite to the door. This is a\\nsimple and, in our view, solemn and neutral\\nway of identifying rooms in which a patient\\nis dying. The candle illustration on a closed\\ndoor helps to set this room apart from the\\nadjacent hurried, often loud ICU environment.\\nThe signage is intended not only to identify\\ncomfort care patients but also to encourage\\nstaff members to adapt their words and actions\\naccordingly.\\nCANDLE SYMBOLISM\\nThe candledsince its invention as burning\\nwax\\napproximately\\n3000\\nyears\\nBCdhas\\nevolved into a symbol of light in the darkness,\\na remembrance, a prayer for the dead, and\\ncelebration of major religious holidays.

Later, most Muslims light candles\\non the graves of their loved ones and on\\nshrines of prominent religious ﬁgures. More-\\nover, candles decorate areas with light during\\nRamadan (“Month of Light”). Candles are lit\\nin front of Buddhist shrines or statues as signs\\nof respect and are commonly used at funerals.\\nMany Hindus incorporate ﬁre in ceremonies\\nthat they consider sacred. Diwali (Festival of\\nLights) symbolizes the triumph of good over\\nevil and light over darkness.5\\nIn the modern age, the symbolism of a\\nburning candle is strong and demands seren-\\nity. Candles encountered in large numbers\\ncause people to reﬂect for a moment. For\\nmany of us, it requires little explanation. It\\ncannot be expected to offend even if used in\\npeaceful demonstrations.\\nOUR ADAPTATION OF THE CANDLE\\nTo overcome the usual restrictions against\\nburning candles in a hospital room or ICU,\\nwe designed illustrations of a number of can-\\ndles in coordination with Mayo Clinic Brand\\nStrategy\\nand\\nCreative\\nStudio\\nDepartment\\n(\\x022018 Mayo Foundation for Medical Educa-\\ntion and Research). We placed an illustration\\nof a single burning candle on the door of the\\npatient’s room and illustrations of votive can-\\ndles on the nurses’ station in plastic place-\\nholders opposite or near the room of the\\npatient (Figures 1 and 2). Triggers for place-\\nment were a decision to withdraw support in\\na patient with irrevocable brain injury or in\\npatients designated as potential organ donors\\naccording to brain-death or cardiac-death pro-\\ntocols. The placement of an order set to with-\\ndraw support was used as a trigger to place\\nthe illustrations, but the nursing staff addition-\\nally conﬁrmed this order with physicians to\\navoid misunderstandings. Families were noti-\\nﬁed and gave verbal consent for the placement\\nof illustrations. The illustrations remained in\\nplace until the family members had said their\\nlast goodbyes and left the unit. The door cards\\nwere Oxivir wiped, stored, and reused. Our\\npreliminary trial lasted for a year.\\nTHE RESPONSE\\nThe response was immediately supportive. Staff\\npresent in the unit rapidly understood the sig-\\nniﬁcance of the candle and toned down their\\nconversation while passing the room. Many\\ninitially asked what the candle was for but\\nquickly\\nappreciated\\nthe\\nsymbolism\\nafter\\nreceiving\\nan\\nexplanation.\\nNursing\\nstaff\\nremained motivated to use the illustrations after\\nthe pilot study ended. The placeholders did not\\nobstruct administrative trafﬁc. Family members\\nwere likewise very appreciative―the spouse of\\none patient was so moved by the site of the can-\\ndle door card that she requested to take it home\\nin remembrance of her husband. Others have\\nremarked that the simplicity of the gesture\\npositively impacted the death experience by\\npromoting a more personalized atmosphere\\nand dignity. No negative experiences were\\nidentiﬁed.\\nFIGURE 1.

Our neurointensive care unit\\nadmits many patients with acute catastrophic\\nbrain injury, but in only a fraction―approxi-\\nmately 5 patients per month―the devastating\\nﬁndings and agreed-upon futility of care results\\nin withdrawal of care. When walking through\\nthe unit, ICU staff and visiting family members\\nmay have to identify which room has a dying (or\\ndeceased patient). We have also been struck by\\nthe\\nimpersonal―but\\nnecessary―protocolized\\nmanagement of the deceased (ie, closed curtains\\nand cold stop signs). Our experience with the\\nadditional placement of candle illustrations\\nhas been very satisfactory. These illustrations\\nmay not only bring down noise levels, often\\nrelated to staff conversations,6,7 but also serve\\nas a part of holistic care to patients whose lives\\nare drawing to an end. Families and all health\\ncare workers with different beliefs (or no belief)\\nappear to appreciate the symbolism of the can-\\ndle placed outside the room of the dying pa-\\ntient, but it only goes so far to assuage the\\ngrief. We do not pretend this placement of can-\\ndle illustrations alleviates the bereavement pro-\\ncess, but we do not envision any negative effect.\\nDespite an increasingly secular world, religious\\nbeliefs continue to play a role in managing end-\\nof-life care, and the candle illustrations will\\nafﬁrm its symbolism for many. We perceive\\nthe candle illustration as a neutral symbol that\\nnevertheless respects faith-based and other in-\\nterpretations. The candle illustration should\\nnot take away hope for a miracle in some family\\nmembers even after the decision is made to go to\\ncomfort measures. The placard should be used\\nonly for those patients who transitioned to com-\\nfort care and after full agreement to withdrawal\\nof support but also with physicians anticipating\\nearly demise.\\nOur trial was performed in the neurointen-\\nsive care unit, but we do not foresee concerns\\nwhen candles are used in other types of ICUs.\\nIts continuing use after the patient is moved\\nout of the ICU to a regular ward may be\\nconsidered.\\nOur illustrations have a noticeable color\\nscheme and are large enough for easy notice.\\nThe alternative or additional use of battery-\\noperated candles may be physically more difﬁ-\\ncult, but we have allowed them in patients’\\nrooms at the families’ request.\\nCandles have long symbolized part of the\\nMayo Clinic model of care. The Sisters of Saint\\nFrancis, who founded Saint Marys Hospital\\nand welcomed people from all faiths, believed\\nin prayer as a key component of care. Dr Wil-\\nliam J. Mayo, who came from a different tradi-\\ntion,\\nrespected\\nand\\nhonored\\nthe\\nSisters’\\ndevotion to patients. He often told the Sisters,\\n“I’ll pay for the candles, and you light them.”\\nFIGURE 2.

       " 'Introduction\\nPatients\\nadmitted\\nto\\nthe\\nNeurocritical\\nCare\\nUnit\\n(NCCU) may have the potential for unmet palliative care\\nneeds given medical complexity, communication barriers\\ndirectly with patients, and prognostic uncertainty coupled\\nwith the acute and sometimes devastating debility of the\\ndisease1. Data shows that palliative needs may be present\\nin up to 62% of patients admitted to the NCCU, with large\\nischemic strokes or intracerebral hemorrhage requiring\\nmechanical ventilation being most common and particu-\\nlarly vulnerable.2-5 However, data from the National\\nInpatient Sample that included 395,411 stroke patients,\\nreported palliative care encounters in only 6.2% of\\npatients.6 Furthermore, both patients admitted to an\\nIntensive Care Unit (ICU) and their family members may\\nsuffer from new or worsening physical, cognitive or men-\\ntal health distress, beyond the acute hospitalization phase\\nknown as “Post-intensive care syndrome” or “Post-inten-\\nsive care syndrome-family”.7-8\\nThus, in recent years, palliative care collaboration\\nwith the intensive care teams has become integrated\\ninto\\npractice\\nfor\\nhigh-quality,\\ncomprehensive\\ncare\\nacross many intensive care settings. Speciﬁc triggers\\nfor palliative consultations reported in the literature\\nwithin this population include intracerebral hemor-\\nrhage, mechanical ventilation, clarifying goals of care,\\nfamily support, decision making, discharge planning\\nand communication.4,9-10 Proactive multi-disciplinary\\nmeasures\\nhave\\nshown\\nto\\nimprove\\ncommunication,\\npatient and family centeredness of care, reduced the\\nlength of ICU stay, completion of advanced care plan-\\nning, and overall quality of care in patients with vari-\\nous devastating illnesses.11-18\\nThe overarching goal of palliative care medicine is to\\nfocus on goal concordant care, which can further be\\ndeﬁned\\nas\\nconcentrating\\non\\npatient\\ncentered\\ncare,\\nwhether that be, curative, rehabilitative, or for comfort.\\nThis\\nincludes\\nmanaging\\nphysical\\nand\\npsychological\\nsymptoms; addressing spiritual, social and cultural needs;\\nimproving understanding of disease process; and/or end-\\nof-life discussions.19 Integrating early palliative care\\nassessments into patient care can improve a patient’s\\nsocial support, communication, advance care planning,\\nand satisfaction of the patients and their surrogates with\\noverall quality of life.11-12, 20-21\\nOur primary objective was to determine if early collabo-\\nrative care within the NCCU with integration of palliative\\ncare consultations was feasible and if it improved under-\\nstanding, decision-making and emotional support to\\npatients and surrogate decision makers in critically ill\\nstroke patients. Our secondary objective was to evaluate\\nthe impact of palliative care support on the development\\nof post-traumatic stress disorder amongst either patients\\nor their surrogate decision makers.\\nMethods\\nThis was a prospective study approved by the IRB at\\nour comprehensive stroke center. Patients were recruited\\nand enrolled from February 2019 \\x01 January 2020, with\\nﬁnal follow up completed in April 2020. The NCCU is a\\n24-bed closed unit that provides specialized care to criti-\\ncally ill neurosurgical, neurological, and post-operative\\npatients.\\nStudy population\\nInclusion and exclusion criteria\\nAll patients admitted to the NCCU with moderate to\\nsevere ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke were screened for\\npotential inclusion, regardless of intubation status. Moder-\\nate to severe ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke was deﬁned\\nas a patient with a Modiﬁed Rankin Score (mRS) of 3 or\\nabove at time of presentation (on a scale of 0 \\x01 6, where 0\\nhas no symptoms, 3 is “Moderate disability. Requires some\\nhelp, but able to walk unassisted”, and 6 is death), and an\\nNIHSS of 10 or greater. We utilized data extrapolated\\nfrom the landmark TOAST clinical trial22 to best under-\\nstand what NIHSS would be consistent with a moderate\\nto severe stroke with disability. Based on this landmark\\npaper, an NIHSS of 16 or greater indicated a strong prob-\\nability of patient death, while a baseline NIHSS of less\\nthan 6 indicated a strong probability of good recovery.\\nThus, a rounded median between these two values, or a\\nvalue of 10, was chosen to indicate a moderate to severe\\ndisability. The mRS is a validated measure of physical dis-\\nability, standardly used to assess and evaluate patient’s\\noutcomes after stroke.23 NIHSS was superseded by mRS\\nas an inclusion criterion, as it elucidated the importance\\nof requiring assistance and overall mobility. Furthermore,\\npatients with premorbid baseline deﬁcits of mRS > 2\\nwere excluded from our study and mRS was calculated\\nusing the stroke severity on presentation.\\nPatients and caregivers were approached for study\\nenrollment based on the following criteria: age 18 years\\nand above, anticipated admission to the NCCU for greater\\nthan 48 hours, NIHSS \\x01 10, mRS \\x01 3, and an identiﬁable\\nsurrogate decision maker or legal next of kin with the abil-\\nity to speak English and consent to participate in the\\nstudy. Patients were excluded from consideration if they\\nwere pregnant, incarcerated, presented with subarach-\\nnoid hemorrhage, transitioned to comfort care within\\n48 hours of admission, admitted to the NCCU after a\\nplanned neurosurgical procedure, or lacked an identiﬁ-\\nable surrogate decision maker or legal next of kin with the\\nability to speak English and consent to participate in a\\ntimely manner.\\nAt the time of screening, patients had already been\\nadmitted to the NCCU, and thus, most acute emergent\\nischemic stroke interventions, including administration of\\n2\\nH.A. KAMDAR ET AL.\\nintravenous\\ntissue\\nplasminogen\\nactivator\\n(tPA)\\nand\\nmechanical thrombectomy (MT) were already completed.\\nHowever, if a patient was admitted with a hemorrhagic\\nstroke, an extraventricular drain (EVD) placement, and/\\nor hemicrianiectomy (HC) may or may not have been\\ndone depending on the patient’s clinical presentation.\\nParticipant characteristics\\nParticipants include patients and their surrogate deci-\\nsion makers. Demographic information included: age,\\ngender, ethnicity, educational status, marital status, and\\nemployment status. Clinical data included: patient base-\\nline comorbidities, stroke type (hemorrhagic, ischemic,\\nischemic with hemorrhagic conversion), degree of stroke\\nseverity on admission and discharge based on mRS and\\nNational Institute of Stroke Scale (NIHSS), code status on\\nadmission and discharge, length of NCCU stay, length of\\ntotal hospital stay, and discharge disposition.\\nRandomization\\nOnce participants were screened and met inclusion and\\nexclusion criteria, they were approached for study enroll-\\nment and informed consent. Once consented, they were\\nrandomized into either control or intervention arms. Ran-\\ndomization was done en block to allow for equal distribu-\\ntion in both groups and included patients treated by\\nvarious care providers. Allocation of participants was\\nequally distributed into control and intervention arms\\nwith an allocation ratio of 1:1.\\nIntervention and Control Arms\\nIn both groups, routine management of ischemic or\\nhemorrhagic strokes, mechanical ventilation, and sys-\\ntemic complications, was performed based on the stan-\\ndard of care deﬁned by the American Stroke Association\\nGuidelines.24 This included all acute or emergent inter-\\nventions approved by the Federal Drug Administration\\nfor ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke including the admin-\\nistration of tPA, MT, EVD placement, and/or HC if indi-\\ncated. In the control arm, the patient received routine\\nNCCU care with palliative care consultation placed per\\nthe discretion of the treating team. In the intervention\\narm, the patient received early palliative care consulta-\\ntion. This consisted of two meetings, the ﬁrst occurred\\nwithin 72 hours of admission to the NCCU, and the sec-\\nond one was conducted at, at least, 5-7 days after admis-\\nsion, or prior to discharge.\\nPrior to all palliative interventions, the primary NCCU\\nteam had a collaborative and comprehensive discussion\\nwith the palliative care team focusing particularly on the\\nunderstanding of where the patient was in the spectrum\\nof the natural history of disease, and the presence or lack\\nof prognostic indicators at that particular time. During the\\npalliative care consultation, a member of the palliative\\nteam assessed the participants and surrogate decision\\nmakers palliative care needs using the eight domains of\\npalliative care. Speciﬁc emphasis was placed on patient\\nand/or surrogate decision maker’s understanding of dis-\\nease process, prognostic awareness, and elements of\\nshared decision-making in collaboration with the NCCU\\nteam. The majority of palliative care consultation meet-\\nings were conducted with a member of the NCCU team;\\nhowever, if the team was not present, they were notiﬁed\\nof the salient points of the discussion and if any preferen-\\nces away from the current care were voiced (for example,\\nthe participant wanted to have end of life discussions,\\nchange in code status or elected to shift to comfort meas-\\nures). If these preferences were identiﬁed, further conver-\\nsations were done with the surrogate decision maker\\ntogether with both the primary NCCU team and the con-\\nsultant palliative team.\\nStudy instruments & outcomes\\nStudy outcomes were assessed through validated surveys\\ngiven to both groups of participants during the following\\nthree-time frames:\\n1) Time 1: Day 1-3 of admission to the NCCU and if\\nwithin the intervention arm, prior to the palliative\\ncare encounter (in-person),\\n2) Time 2: Day 5-7 of hospital care or prior to discharge,\\n3) Time 3: At 3-months post-discharge (phone-call)\\n(Table 2).\\nAt time point one and two, three surveys were distrib-\\nuted to participants: Questionnaire on Communication\\n(QoC), Decisional Conﬂict Scale (DCS), and Hospital Anxi-\\nety and Depression Scale (HADS). Finally, at time point\\nthree, participants were asked to complete the Hospital\\nAnxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Post Traumatic\\nStress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL- 5). Surveys were\\nﬁlled by the surrogate decision maker alone, or in conjunc-\\ntion with the patient based on their ability to participate.\\nQuestionnaire on Communication (QoC)\\nThe Quality of Communication questionnaire is a sev-\\nenteen-item survey developed from qualitative studies\\nwith patients, families and clinicians, in which thirteen\\nitems measured two components of communication: gen-\\neral communication (six items) and communication about\\ngoals of care (seven items). Items are scored from 0 \\x01 10,\\nwith higher scores indicating better communication.25\\nDecisional conﬂict scale (DCS)\\nThe Decisional Conﬂict Scale is a sixteen-point instru-\\nment, measuring individual’s perceptions of uncertainty\\nPALLIATIVE INTEGRATION IN CRITICAL STROKE PATIENTS\\n3\\nin choosing options and modiﬁable factors contributing to\\nuncertainty, such as feeling uninformed, unclear about\\npersonal values, and unsupported decision-making.26\\nHigher scores indicated higher decisional conﬂict.\\nHospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)\\nThe Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale is a fourteen-\\nitem assessment with subscales of anxiety and depression\\nthat have been validated and reliable amongst surrogates\\nand other trials of behavioral interventions.27-28 Each\\ndomain has a score range of 0\\x0121; 0\\x017 = normal; 8\\x0110=\\nborderline abnormal; 11\\x0121 = abnormal, with higher\\nscores indicating higher levels of anxiety and depression.\\nThis was measured at three different time frames (twice\\nduring hospitalization and once during the 3 month follow\\nup phone survey) to determine, the changes with our inter-\\nvention. HADS values at 1 week have correlated with\\nsymptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder 3 months fol-\\nlowing ICU stay.29\\nPost-traumatic stress disorder checklist for DSM-5\\n(PCL- 5)\\nThe symptoms of PTSD were assessed using the Post\\nTraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5 by a tele-\\nphone survey at 3 months post-discharge, i.e., 3 months\\nafter the inciting event.30 The PCL-5 is a 20-item self-\\nreport measure that assesses 20 symptoms of PTSD and is\\nused for screening individuals for PTSD.\\nStatistical methods\\nDescriptive statistics were conducted to describe the\\ncharacteristics and scores of the patient sample overall\\nand stratiﬁed by intervention. Comparisons between\\ngroups were performed using two sample t-tests for nor-\\nmally-distributed continuous variables and Mann\\x01Whit-\\nney\\nU-tests\\nfor\\nnon-normally-distributed\\ncontinuous\\nvariables, as well as Fisher’s exact test for categorical vari-\\nables with small sample sizes. Results were reported as\\nmean and standard deviation and median and interquar-\\ntile range when appropriate.\\nLinear mixed effects models were conducted to exam-\\nine the association between intervention and patients’ or\\nsurrogate decision maker’s scores at different time points.\\nIndividual patients were entered as a random effects\\nterm. The models were ﬁt via maximum likelihood esti-\\nmation using the lme function from the nlme package in\\nR (v3.4.1, R Foundation, Vienna, Austria) and R Studio\\n(v1.0.153, RStudio Inc., Boston, MA). For all analyses,\\np-values <0.05 were considered statistically signiﬁcant.\\nWe decided a priori to conduct four separate models for\\neach of the four scales and include intervention, timepoint\\nif present, and score in each baseline model. We explored\\nthe interaction between intervention and timepoint when\\nappropriate (e.g., only for QoC, DCS, and HADS scores).\\nOther variables were added to the model if they had a p\\nvalue <0.20 for the relationship between the variable and\\nscore in a baseline model that also included the interven-\\ntion and timepoint.\\nWe chose not to attempt to perform multivariable\\nmodeling using forward and backward selections meth-\\nods and did not adjust for multiple comparisons using\\nHolm\\x01Bonferroni method due to the inherent limited\\nsample size and degrees of freedom available in this\\nhypothesis-generating study.\\nResults\\nParticipant baseline characteristics\\nOf the 431 patients initially screened from 2/4/2019 \\x01\\n1/5/2020, 106 met initial screening criteria of moderate to\\nsevere ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke admitted to the\\nNCCU. Of these 78 were excluded: 41 did not have an\\nidentiﬁable surrogate decision maker available to consent\\nor actively participate in the study, 30 declined participa-\\ntion, 6 were participating in another trial which did not\\nallow for multiple study enrollments, and 1 was excluded\\nbased on attending preference; leaving 28 consented and\\nenrolled participants. Of the 28 participants, 22 completed\\nthe study, and 6 were removed from analysis due to\\ninability to complete pre/post surveys (Fig. 1). Of the 22\\nparticipants who completed the study, 11 patients were\\nrandomized to each arm. Of the 11 patients within the\\ncontrol arm, none received palliative consultation.\\nParticipant characteristics are outlined in Table 1. The\\nmajority of all survey responders (n=21/22, 95.45%)\\nwithin both the control and intervention arms were surro-\\ngate decision makers. Only one patient participated in the\\nsurveys conducted at 3-month follow up alongside their\\nsurrogate decision maker who had previously ﬁlled out\\nsurveys during the patient’s hospitalization. The majority\\nof patients were Caucasian (81.82%), experienced an\\nischemic stroke (59.09%), and had surrogates who had\\ncompleted at least some college (71.43%). The average\\npatient age was 62.73 (§ 14.93) and an average NIHSS\\nscore at admission was 16.18 (Standard Deviation = 7.63).\\nThere were no signiﬁcant differences in patient character-\\nistics between the two groups (Table 1). Similarly, base-\\nline characteristics of enrolled surrogate decision makers\\nwere largely similar except for a statistically signiﬁcant\\ndifference between the education status of the surrogate\\ndecision maker, with a higher percentage of advanced\\ndegree in the intervention arm (p=0.009). (Table 1).\\nAmongst both groups, eight patients in each arm pre-\\nsented with ischemic strokes, with one each complicated\\nby hemorrhagic conversion; and three with primary intra-\\nparenchymal\\nhemorrhage\\n(IPH).\\nLocation\\nof\\nstroke,\\nstroke mechanism, and acute stroke interventions that\\nwere\\nperformed\\nare\\noutlined\\nin\\nTable\\n4.\\nStroke\\n4\\nH.A.

There were no signiﬁcant differences in the QoC\\nand DCS scores between the groups and across timepoints\\n(Tables 3). There were, however, signiﬁcant differences in\\nthe total HADS scores (p=0.043), the anxiety subcompo-\\nnent of the HADS score (p=0.016) and the PCL-5 scores\\n(p=0.033) (Table 3). There were both marginal and statisti-\\ncally signiﬁcant interactions between intervention and\\nvarious timepoints for HADS scores (p=0.06 and p=0.028)\\n(Table 3). Additionally, there was statistically signiﬁcant\\ndifference in the PCL5-3 scores between intervention arm\\nand control arm groups at 3 months (p=0.018) (Table 3),\\nsuggesting that early palliative care assessment may lead\\nto a decrease in anxiety, depression and post-traumatic\\nstress experience at three months.\\nPatient discharge disposition and mortality\\nThere was no statistical difference between discharge\\ndisposition or mortality between both groups. Four\\npatients were discharged to inpatient rehab (IPR) in the\\ncontrol group, as compared to the two in the intervention\\narm. Six patients were discharged to skilled nursing\\nfacility (SNF) in the control group as compared to the ﬁve\\nin the intervention. Both these ﬁndings were not signiﬁ-\\ncant.\\nDiscussion\\nOur study aim was to determine the feasibility of inte-\\ngrating a palliative care assessment earlier in the hospital\\ncourse to improve communication and goal concordant\\ncare. We aimed to characterize the impact of this interven-\\ntion on patient and surrogate decision maker outcomes\\nsuch as quality of communication, decision-making, anxi-\\nety and depression, and PTSD) using validated tools. Our\\nunadjusted data for total 3-month PCL5 score in patients\\nand surrogates who received palliative care intervention\\nwas signiﬁcantly lower compared to standard care. When\\ncompared to the standard of care group, patients receiv-\\ning palliative care reported scores corresponding to less\\nanxiety and depression at three months relative to base-\\nline and immediately after palliative care consultation.\\nThese data indicate that palliative care integration may\\nhave a long-term beneﬁt in critically ill stroke patients in\\nterms of anxiety, depression, and PTSD.\\nFurthermore, our study did not reveal a statistically sig-\\nniﬁcant effect on mortality rate when comparing both\\narms, a salient concern of many providers being cognizant\\nof avoiding self-fulﬁlling prophecies (SFPs) and prema-\\nture withdrawal of care. This is especially of concern\\nwithin the NCCU, where biomarkers of prognostication\\nFig. 1.

Furthermore, given the limit in population\\nsize we remained cautious to make any inference to statisti-\\ncal signiﬁcance or non-signiﬁcance regarding prognostic\\nfactors that may have potentially impacted shared decision\\nmaking. Additionally, phone surveys inherently carry a\\nnon-response limitation, which affects the sample size of\\nour three-month follow up surveys.

       " \"INTRODUCTION\\nNeurocritical patients admitted to the neurosurgical inten-\\nsive care unit (NS-ICU) often present with acutely debilitating\\nneurological conditions, stemming from acute ischemic/hem-\\norrhagic stroke, traumatic brain injury, or other non-traumatic\\nbrain injuries, such as highly aggressive brain neoplasms\\n35).\\nWhile comprehensive statistics on the epidemiology of neuro-\\ncritical patients in South Korea are currently unavailable, the\\ncountry is witnessing a surge in traumatic brain injuries\\n9,32) and\\nvascular events\\n1,14,19) with the aging population, hinting at a po-\\ntential rise in the demand for neurocritical care in the future.\\nConcurrently, the socioeconomic burden associated with car-\\ning for neurocritical patients is gradually increasing\\n5,20).\\nCritically ill neurosurgical patients exhibit distinctive fea-\\ntures that set them apart from other seriously ill individuals\\n11,12).\\nDespite intensive treatment, they often face heightened mortal-\\nity and clinical uncertainty, with outcomes varying significant-\\nly. The life-threatening nature of their condition may lead to\\nearly death\\n28), especially post-decision to withdraw life-sustain-\\ning interventions, or substantial disability upon survival. Fam-\\nily caregivers, grappling with the patient’s acute neurological\\nchanges, encounter challenges in surrogate decision-making\\nand bear a substantial caregiving responsibility\\n25). Even for\\nthose who survive, functional decline may persist. Therefore,\\nthere is an urgent need to enhance the quality of life for both\\nneurocritical patients and their caregivers\\n11).\\nPalliative care is a specialized approach designed to enhance\\nthe quality of life for both patients and their families through\\npatient-centered care, involving comprehensive assessment and\\ncare planning\\n30). The application of palliative care varies ac-\\ncording to the illness trajectory. In progressive diseases such as\\ncancer, the early integration of palliative care alongside disease\\ntreatment has been shown to substantially improve the quality\\nof life for patients and their families. This integration also pro-\\nmotes the appropriate utilization of end-of-life medical care\\n10).\\nHowever, the role of palliative care and its effective integration\\ninto the treatment of patients with an acute illness trajectory\\nwere not well-understood until the introduction of an initiative\\nto enhance the quality of palliative care in ICUs in 2010\\n31). Since\\nthen, as part of the palliative care approach in the ICU, various\\ninterventions have been introduced, including decision-making\\nsupport\\n3), family support\\n4,36), and ethics consultation\\n2,29). These\\nefforts have resulted in positive outcomes, including a notable\\nreduction in distress experienced by ICU patients, their fami-\\nlies, and healthcare professionals. Additionally, there has been\\nan increase in patient and family satisfaction\\n13), coupled with a\\ndecrease in the overall length of ICU stay\\n18,27). Also, recently, the\\nconcept of neuro-palliative care has been evolving, addressing\\nthe unique needs of patients with neurological conditions\\n11).\\nWhile recent research has highlighted the potential significance\\nof facilitating goals of care discussions among those patients\\n28),\\nparticularly those struggling to make independent decisions,\\nthe integration of palliative care in the NS-ICU remains under-\\nvalued.\\nIn South Korea, as in other countries, patients with neuro-\\ncritical conditions and their families may have significant palli-\\native care needs. Despite the enforcement of the Act on hospice\\nand palliative care and decisions on life-sustaining treatment\\n(LST) for patients at the end of life (hereafter, LST Decisions\\nAct) in 2018\\n16), hospice palliative services are inaccessible to\\nneurocritical patients admitted to the NS-ICU although those\\nwith very limited prospects of recovery or who are brain-dead\\nhave been traditionally seen as candidates for end-of-life care.\\nHowever, from the perspective of extending palliative care be-\\nyond end-of-life care to address “living well” rather than merely\\n“dying well,” some opinions suggest that neurosurgical ICU\\npatients, who may face various challenges and needs even with\\nsuccessful treatment, could also be considered appropriate can-\\ndidates for palliative care. This descriptive study aims to identi-\\nfy the characteristics, palliative care needs, and outcomes of\\npatients referred to palliative care services during admission to\\nthe NS-ICU.\\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\\nThe study protocol underwent review and received approval\\nfrom the Institutional Review Board of at Seoul National Uni-\\nversity Hospital (SNUH) (No. H-2205-180-1331). Informed\\nconsent was waived following the protocol of the Institutional\\nReview Board due to the retrospective design of the study.\\nStudy design and objects\\nThis retrospective study focused on adult patients admitted\\nto the NS-ICU at a tertiary hospital in South Korea. Since 2018,\\na full-time neuro-intensivist has been stationed in the 12-bed\\nNS-ICU at SNUH. On average, approximately 30 neuro-criti-\\nTraumatic Optic Neuropathy | Kim NH, et al.\\n215\\nJ Korean Neurosurg Soc 68 (2) : 213-222\\ncally ill patients are admitted to this unit each year. The study\\nspecifically targeted adult patients referred to the inpatient pal-\\nliative care team after admission to the NS-ICU, with primary\\ndiagnoses of non-traumatic brain hemorrhage, traumatic brain\\ninjury, or brain neoplasm. Excluded from the study were pa-\\ntients who died before meeting the palliative care team or those\\nwith insufficient medical records.\\nInpatient palliative care consultation process\\nLacking a dedicated hospice ward or home hospice, SNUH\\nexclusively offers inpatient palliative care consultation services.\\nThe inpatient palliative care consultation team consists of two\\nphysicians, one specializing in palliative care, and a clinical fel-\\nlow in internal medicine or family medicine. Additionally, the\\nteam includes one palliative care nurse and one medical social\\nworker (0.5 full time equivalent). This team engages with the\\npatient and their family, conducting interviews, performing\\ncomprehensive assessments, exploring and discussing care ob-\\njectives, and providing guidance to healthcare professionals.\\nWhen interviewing is not feasible due to the patient’s condition\\nin the NS-ICU, clinical evaluations are carried out, and family\\nmembers are interviewed. The palliative care team particularly\\ncomes into play when a primary attending clinician (neuro-in-\\ntensivist or neurosurgeon) initiates an on-demand palliative\\ncare referral based on the patient’s palliative care needs.\\nMeasurements\\nWe collected comprehensive patient data, including socio-\\ndemographics (age and sex), clinical details (severity, neurologi-\\ncal condition, diagnosis, and comorbidities), consultation-relat-\\ned characteristics, and post-consultation healthcare resource\\nutilization from medical records and palliative care interview\\nnotes. Severity at ICU admission was assessed using the\\n12-point Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, and the\\nGlasgow coma scale (GCS) measured conditions at ICU entry,\\ncategorized as 8 or less, or 9 or more. Clinical diagnoses were\\nclassified as traumatic or non-traumatic, and by hemorrhage\\ntype (intracerebral, intraventricular, subarachnoid, or subdu-\\nral). Comorbidities covered cancer, organ failure (chronic heart,\\npulmonary, liver, or renal), and neurodegenerative diseases.\\nPrognostic evaluation scores determined in-hospital mortality\\nand functional dependency, with specific measures for trau-\\nmatic brain injury (FOUR score), subarachnoid hemorrhage\\n(modified Fisher grading scale, Hunt & Hess score), and intra-\\ncerebral/intraventricular hemorrhage (Functional outcome\\nscore and intracerebral hemorrhage score).\\nThe contents of palliative care consultations were extracted\\nfrom interview notes, encompassing reasons for consultation,\\nthe number of interviews conducted, the number of partici-\\npants interviews with the palliative care team, family’s under-\\nstanding of patient conditions, patient’s and family’s preferenc-\\nes for LSTs, medical procedures requiring discussion, and\\ndisagreements on treatment decisions.\\nTo investigate the outcomes of palliative care consultations,\\nwe compared changes in code status before and after the con-\\nsultation, length of hospital stays, mortality, and discharge lo-\\ncation. The classification of code status included three catego-\\nries : full code (indicating the implementation of all active\\nmeasures), comfort care (focused on relief), and partial code\\n(not requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation but needing es-\\nsential medical treatment). An investigation was conducted on\\nthe medical treatment received by patients who died at SNUH\\nwithin 48 hours of their death.\\nStatistical analysis\\nDescriptive data were utilized to summarize the demograph-\\nic and clinical characteristics of the patients, as well as the out-\\ncomes of palliative care consultations. For categorical variables,\\nPearson’s chi-squared test or Fisher’s exact test was applied. The\\ncomparison of code status proportions before and after pallia-\\ntive care consultation was conducted using McNemar-Bowker’s\\ntest. Overall survival, defined as the time from the date of palli-\\native care consultation to the date of death, was analyzed using\\nKaplan-Meier estimation. The log-rank test was employed to\\ncompare overall survival according to various variables. All\\nstatistical analyses were two-sided, with statistical significance\\nset at p<0.05. The analyses were conducted using STATA ver-\\nsion 16.0 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA).\\nRESULTS\\nPatient characteristics\\nA total of 38 patients were enrolled between December 2019\\nand December 2021, and baseline characteristics are detailed in\\nTable 1.

Further-\\nmore, the research reveals a noteworthy finding : a shift towards\\ncomfort-oriented code status following palliative care consulta-\\ntion. Importantly, our study illuminates the trajectory of pallia-\\ntive care for neurosurgical patients and their families, a group\\noften overlooked but needing palliative care alongside intensive\\ncare as comprehensive approaches.\\nOur study shows that the primary reason doctors referred\\npatients to palliative care was for family psychosocial support,\\naligning with trends seen in similar ICUs abroad\\n34). Interna-\\ntionally, a neuro-ICU study revealed that 62% of patients and\\ntheir families had palliative care needs, with 53% requiring so-\\ncial support\\n7). Particularly regarding anxiety and depression,\\nseveral prospective studies revealed that the prevalence of mod-\\nerate to severe mood symptoms was identified in 36.4% to\\n54.5% of family members of patients with severe acute brain in-\\njury\\n6,24,25). Some studies additionally reported that caregivers\\nare at a greater risk for post-traumatic stress and burden\\n8,24).\\nOur study suggests that doctors identified the needs of family\\ncaregivers during discussions of treatment plans as most pa-\\ntients were not able to communicate, resulting in a high preva-\\nlence of family support as the referral cause.\\nIn alignment with previous research on palliative care needs\\nfor critically ill patients\\n27), our study identifies goals of care con-\\nversations and decision-making support as major reasons for\\nreferral. Ensuring goal-concordant care for patients and their\\nfamilies is of utmost importance in patient-centered care, a\\nprinciple that extends to patient care in the NS-ICU. However,\\nas our research demonstrates, only around half of the cases al-\\nlow for the estimation of patient values and preferences. Mak-\\ning decisions on behalf of NS-ICU patients’ families is, there-\\nfore, challenging in such situations\\n28). Ethical principles guiding\\nsurrogate decision-making say that the tendency to omit deter-\\nmining or estimating the patient’s previous wishes and to rely\\nsolely on the surrogate’s opinion should be avoided\\n21). In our\\nstudy, tracheostomy, often chosen in approximately 30% of pa-\\ntients with severe acute brain injury\\n17), and MV were the main\\noptions that required discussion. According to a qualitative\\nstudy reflecting on tracheostomy decisions in family members\\nof patients with severe acute brain injury\\n22), meeting a funda-\\nmental need for supportive, consistent communication cen-\\ntered around compassion, clarity, and hope would help family\\nmembers make surrogate decisions regardless of the eventual\\noutcomes. The role of palliative care in the context of decision-\\nmaking support is not necessarily to encourage a transition to\\ncomfort care but to support the surrogate decision-makers by\\nfacilitating discussions centered on the patient, thereby guiding\\nthe surrogate decision-making process and reconciling dis-\\nagreements\\n11).\\nOur study reveals an anticipated shift towards favoring com-\\nfort care both before and after palliative care consultation, con-\\nsistent with findings from research where palliative care was\\nadministered in the ICU\\n3,13,26,33), showing higher rates of Do-\\nNot-Resuscitate orders and a preference for comfort care. This\\nobserved association may be due to the process in which pallia-\\ntive care helps clarify the patient’s understanding of their dis-\\nease state, explores preferences for patient-centered decision-\\nmaking, and prompts consideration of goals of care. This\\nprocess often leads family members to develop a more realistic\\nunderstanding of the disease and make more informed deci-\\nsions about LSTs. The integration of early palliative care in\\nICUs is predicted to reduce the length of hospital stay and costs\\nby minimizing non-beneficial aggressive interventions for pa-\\ntients on LST, based on international experiences\\n15,18,26,36,37).\\nHowever, in Korea, changes in code status may not directly in-\\ndicate the withholding or withdrawal of LST due to the 2018\\nLST Decisions Act. The Act allows LST only for patients in the\\ndying process, posing challenges in determining the dying pro-\\ncess for neurocritical patients not brain dead. Further research\\nis needed to understand how changes in code status align with\\nthe LST Decision Act.\\nIn our study, 84.2% of patients referred to palliative care ulti-\\nmately died, while the survivors necessitated long-term care.\\nMV was administered to all patients and functioned as an LST,\\nwith the consideration of withdrawal\\n12). The decision to discon-\\ntinue MV in these cases involves ethical considerations for\\nhealthcare professionals\\n11). Should the decision be made to stop\\nMV, it is essential to provide support for the emotional needs of\\nthe family. Notably, our study reveals that 40% of patients re-\\nferred to palliative care received comfort treatment. The ade-\\nquacy of such treatment may be compromised when end-of-life\\nsymptoms in neuro-critical patients are underestimated, as\\nthey may not manifest distressing symptoms themselves. How-\\never, a significant level of distressing signs was reported to be\\nJ Korean Neurosurg Soc 68 | March 2025\\n220\\nhttps://doi.org/10.3340/jkns.2024.0065\\nobserved at the end-of-life\\n38). It is suggested that palliative care\\ncan contribute to appropriate end-of-life care in such circum-\\nstances\\n33).\\nThe findings of our study offer insights to the ongoing dis-\\ncourse concerning the implementation of palliative care for pa-\\ntients in the NS-ICU In South Korea. From a clinical stand-\\npoint, further deliberation is imperative regarding the optimal\\ncriteria for administering palliative care. Existing literature\\nsuggests traumatic brain injury with a poor neurological prog-\\nnosis, extensive intracranial hemorrhage/subarachnoid hemor-\\nrhage with no surgical interventions, hypoxic ischemic enceph-\\nalopathy, low presenting GCS (<8 for >1 week or Glasgow\\noutcome score <3), or two or more multisystem organ failure as\\ntriggers for palliative care referral\\n23,26). However, recognizing\\npotential variations attributable to distinct national and cultur-\\nal contexts, it becomes essential to propose indicators tailored\\nto national circumstances. Institutionally, the study under-\\nscores a noteworthy incongruity where existing policies do not\\nalign with the paradigm shift towards the early integration of\\npalliative care within disease-centered treatment. Additionally,\\naccess to hospice services for patients in the NS-ICU in South\\nKorea is restricted, except for cases involving malignant brain\\nneoplasms. The implementation of palliative care may require\\nthe establishment of a pertinent system to address these unique\\nchallenges.\\nThis study’s limitations stem from its focus on a single tertia-\\nry care center with a small subject pool, limiting the generaliz-\\nability of findings. Palliative care consultation was formally in-\\ntegrated into the Korean healthcare system following the\\nimplementation of the LST Decision Act in 2018, which limited\\nour data collection to that year onward. Given that palliative\\ncare consultation in the NS-ICU is still in its early stages, con-\\nducting a multicenter study to increase case numbers was not\\nfeasible. The limited number of patients admitted to the NS-\\nICU in this setting also made it unavoidable for our study to be\\na small-scale descriptive study. However, within the context of\\nlimited palliative care for critically ill neurosurgical patients in\\nSouth Korea, the study holds significance. Second, the absence\\nof a control group hinders the ability to compare and assess the\\nunique impact of palliative care. Unfortunately, as a control\\ngroup, we would have needed to select patients who did not re-\\nceive palliative care among those using the NS-ICU within a\\nrelatively short period, which predominantly serves patients\\nundergoing scheduled surgeries requiring post-operative ICU\\ncare. These patients did not fit our inclusion criteria, making it\\nimpossible to find an appropriate control group. Future re-\\nsearch should prioritize prospective comparative studies to\\nclarify the effectiveness of such interventions. Additionally, the\\nretrospective nature of the analysis prevents an exploration of\\nsubjective improvements in the quality of life or care perceived\\nby patients or their families in response to palliative care. Since\\nthe primary goal of palliative care is to enhance the quality of\\nlife for patients and their families, assessing patient (or family)-\\nreported outcomes is indeed necessary to demonstrate the ef-\\nfectiveness of palliative care. Although our study, being a retro-\\nspective analysis, had limitations in systematically evaluating\\nsuch outcomes, it will be crucial for future prospective studies\\nto include outcomes such as quality of life, decision-making\\nconflicts, and mood to assess effectiveness.\\nCONCLUSION\\nIn conclusion, for patients in an NS-ICU, palliative care was\\nmostly consulted for psychosocial support and goals-of-care\\ndiscussion. Despite the difficulties in estimating the patient’s\\ntreatment preference, palliative care consultation supported\\nfamily members and facilitated treatment decision-making.\\nAccording to our study, palliative care was well integrated into\\nclinical practice in neuro-critical care, resulting in more com-\\nfort care at the end-of-life.\\nAUTHORS' DECLARATION\\nConflicts of interest\\nNo potential conflict of interest relevant to this article was\\nreported.\\nInformed consent\\nThis type of study does not require informed consent.\\nAuthor contributions\\nConceptualization : HYP, EJH, SHY; Data curation : NHK,\\nYK, SHY; Formal analysis : NHK, YK, SHY; Funding acquisi-\\ntion : EJH, SHY; Methodology : YK, SHY; Project administra-\\ntion : EJH, SHY; Visualization : NHK, YK, SHY; Writing - orig-\\ninal draft : NHK, YK; Writing - review & editing : SYK, HSH,\\nTraumatic Optic Neuropathy | Kim NH, et al.\\n221\\nJ Korean Neurosurg Soc 68 (2) : 213-222\\nHYP, EJH, SHY\\nData sharing\\nNone\\nPreprint\\nNone\\nORCID\\nNam Hee Kim\\nhttps://orcid.org/0009-0002-1131-8770\\nYejin Kim\\nhttps://orcid.org/0000-0002-1479-3385\\nSe Yeon Kim\\nhttps://orcid.org/0009-0007-3911-9876\\nHyoung Suk Han https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6666-6962\\nHye Yoon Park\\nhttps://orcid.org/0000-0003-4114-5102\\nEun Jin Ha\\nhttps://orcid.org/0000-0003-3278-0550\\nShin Hye Yoo\\nhttps://orcid.org/0000-0001-7473-1082\\n• Acknowledgements\\nThis research was supported by a grant of Patient-Centered\\nClinical Research Coordinating Center (PACEN) funded by\\nthe Ministry of Health & Welfare, Republic of Korea (grant\\nnumber : HC23C0160) and a grant no. 04-2021-0580 from the\\nSeoul National University Hospital Research Fund.\",\n",
       " 'Introduction\\nIn the past, physicians did not routinely seek permission\\nfrom patients before initiating diagnostic and therapeu-\\ntic procedures, regardless of the risk [1]. However, in\\nrecent years, emphasis has been shifted from physician\\nsovereignty to patient autonomy, obliging physicians to\\nexpect and encourage patient participation in decision\\nmaking after having given them all available relevant\\ninformation, thus obtaining the patient’s informed con-\\nsent to perform the given procedure [2,3].

Furthermore, patients\\nand relatives, regardless of the functional outcome, were\\nasked whether they were satisfied with their treatment\\non our neurocritical care unit.\\nMaterials and methods\\nPatients and Setting\\nBetween January 2006 and December 2007, 796 neuro-\\nlogic patients were admitted to our 10-bed neurocritical\\ncare unit (tertiary University Hospital). As we aimed to\\ninvestigate the retrospective consent to specialized neu-\\nrocritical care, we excluded 92 patients from this analy-\\nsis because of (a) being temporarily monitored only\\nafter neuroradiologic procedures (n = 21), (b) represent-\\ning outsourced patients from general ICUs (n = 42), or\\n(c) being lost to follow up (n = 29). A total of 704\\npatients remained eligible for the final analysis. The\\ninstitutional review board approved the study, and con-\\nsent was obtained in written or oral form from all\\npatients or their relatives/legal guardians.\\nData collection\\nWe obtained age, diagnoses, and medical history by\\nreviewing the patients’ hospital charts and institutional\\nelectronic databases. Patients were grouped according to\\ntheir neurologic diagnoses (1, ischemic stroke; 2, intra-\\ncerebral hemorrhage (ICH); 3, subarachnoid hemorrhage\\n(SAH); 4, meningoencephalitis; 5, epileptic seizures; 6,\\nGuillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and myasthenia gravis\\n(MG); 7, neurodegenerative diseases and encephalopa-\\nthy; 8, cerebral neoplasm; and 9, intoxication).\\nPatients or their relatives were contacted by using a\\nmailed standardized questionnaire, which was answered\\nby either the patient or the next of kin or the legal guar-\\ndian (the legal guardianship was reassessed in regular\\nintervals by the responsible courts). In all cases in which\\nthis questionnaire did not return within 6 weeks, a\\nstructured phone interview was conducted with the\\npatients or their closest relatives. The telephone inter-\\nviews were performed by a stroke physician who was\\ntrained and certified for data collection on disability,\\nquality of life, and the modified Rankin Scale (mRS).\\nConsent to participate in this study was obtained in\\nwritten or oral form from all patients or their relatives/\\nlegal guardians. Because of functional impairment or\\ndeath, a proportion of patients were not able to answer\\nthemselves (see Table 1).\\nEnd-point definition\\nPatients were asked to answer four questions: (a) func-\\ntional status (expressed as mRS) before hospital admis-\\nsion, and (b) functional outcome (expressed as mRS)\\n12 months after hospital stay. Furthermore, patients\\nwere asked (c) if they retrospectively agreed with the\\ntreatment (that is, whether they would again consent to\\nneurocritical care, given the experienced functional out-\\ncome 1 year after hospital stay). Consent was defined as\\nthe retrospective approval of the applied life-saving\\nemergency procedures (for example, intubation, place-\\nment of ventricular drains) on admission to the neuro-\\ncritical care unit (thereby explaining that withdrawal of\\nconsent would probably have correlated with rapid clini-\\ncal worsening and the probability of early death). The\\npossibility of answering the question of retrospective\\nconsent to neurocritical care was dichotomized. Finally,\\n(d) patients were asked whether they were satisfied with\\ntheir hospital stay. Satisfaction was defined as general\\ncontentment with the neuro-ICU (NICU) stay, wilfully\\nneglecting the functional outcome (that is, contentment\\nwith how the patient and family members were covered\\nby the staff, educated with regard to the prognosis and\\nfuture course of the disease, and experienced decision\\nmaking). The questionnaire provided five possible\\nanswers: very satisfied, satisfied, neither satisfied nor dis-\\nsatisfied, dissatisfied, and very dissatisfied. The answers\\n‘very satisfied’ and ‘satisfied’ were categorized as satis-\\nfied, whereas ‘neither satisfied nor dissatisfied,’ ‘dissatis-\\nfied,’ and ‘very dissatisfied’ were scored as dissatisfied.\\nFunctional outcome was defined as favorable (mRS 0 to\\n1), mild to moderate disability (mRS 2 to 3), severe disabil-\\nity (mRS 4 to 5), and dead (mRS 6) [4], and also as indepen-\\ndent (mRS 0 to 2) versus dependent or dead (mRS 3 to 6).\\nStatistical analysis\\nStatistical analyses were performed by using the SPSS\\n17.0 software package (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).

As\\na key finding, consent was high in patients with good\\nfunctional outcome, whereas survival with a poor func-\\ntional condition was related to the lowest rates of con-\\nsent, especially in stroke patients.\\nFirst, it must noted that patients with acute onset of\\nsevere neurologic disease frequently are not capable of\\nexpressing their preferences regarding acceptance or\\ndecline of life-sustaining procedures [5,6]. Moreover, in\\nthe acute situation, a potentially existing advance direc-\\ntive may not be at hand [7], and relatives, if present, may\\nbe too distraught to participate appropriately in the deci-\\nsion process [8]. In addition, a dissociation of patients’\\nand relatives’ perception appears to exist in that regard,\\nthat survival itself does not necessarily imply survival\\nwith excellent outcome [9]. This may be caused partly by\\nshortcomings during the informed-consent process for\\nplanned procedures [9].\\nConsent to neurointensive care measures the indivi-\\ndual’s satisfaction with being alive. Other studies of non-\\nneurologic patients have shown that an age-related\\ncorrelation might exist between older age and an incline\\nin life satisfaction in women; however, this has not been\\nFigure 2 Consent and satisfaction depending on functional outcome 1 year after discharge.

Further-\\nmore, several studies showed a relation between chronic\\nneurologic illnesses and less life satisfaction [12-15]. As\\nexperienced, severe neurologic diseases, which led to\\nneurointensive care, may have a long-term outcome\\nsimilar to that of severe chronic diseases; this is in line\\nwith our results that more-severe long-term conse-\\nquences lead to less retrospective consent.\\nThe literature on the correlation of retrospective\\nagreement to specific invasive treatment and functional\\noutcome is less conclusive. Although Foerch and collea-\\ngues [16] reported a correlation between the retrospec-\\ntive decision against treatment and rather unfavorable\\noutcome, and Walz and co-workers [17] also concluded\\nthat consent might depend on outcome in patients\\nundergoing hemicraniectomy, other authors did not find\\na relation between functional outcome and retrospective\\nagreement to therapy [18-20]. In another study, the will-\\ningness of patients to undergo intensive care to achieve\\neven 1 additional month of survival was high; however,\\nwhen asked if this would also apply if the patients were\\nin a vegetative or severely neurologically impaired state,\\nwillingness to undergo intensive care was much less\\n[21]. This again shows that there may be a difference in\\naccepting general intensive care compared with neuro-\\nintensive care, as the latter is associated with a higher\\nlikelihood of cognitive impairment.\\nSeveral novel issues presented here add to this discus-\\nsion. Consent to neurocritical care declines with increas-\\ning disability. However, in patients who died in the\\ncourse of the disease, increased rates of consent were\\npresumed by the families. This reflects a previously\\nunnoticed and highly important finding. These results\\nindicate that death may not be judged to be the worst\\noutcome by some patients or their relatives, and a pro-\\nportion of patients may prefer death to severely disabled\\nsurvival or a vegetative state [7,22-26].\\nThe data presented here have several shortcomings.\\nData were collected in a single center, and the sample\\nsize may have limited the statistical power. Furthermore,\\nbecause of intercultural differences, the results may not\\nbe internationally valid. In addition, consent was\\nassessed one year after neurocritical care; however,\\nanswers given in questionnaires or telephone interviews\\nhave an inherent dependence on how the questions are\\nstated, thus possibly leading to discrepancies across\\nsimilar studies. Furthermore, other possibly important\\nparameters, such as depression, were not collected.\\nFinally, the fact that exclusively relatives have answered\\nthe questionnaires in all cases in which patients had\\ndied, represents a systemic bias, as the provision of\\ntime, money, and manpower when caring for patients at\\nhome versus transferring them into a nursing home may\\naffect the given answers.\\nConclusions\\nTwo aspects – (a) incapability to state preferences\\nregarding life-sustaining therapies after symptom onset\\nand missing advance directive, and (b) absent consent to\\nneurocritical care if survival is poor – lead to a thera-\\npeutic dilemma in neurocritical care. Precisely because\\nthe majority of patients are not capable of stating their\\ntreatment preferences, a general initiation of neurocriti-\\ncal care assumes the patients’ agreements in the acute\\nphase [27-30]. This may result in prolonged disease\\nduration and partly delays the decision to limit treat-\\nment until severe complications occur during the course\\nof the disease [22,31,32].

       " 'INTRODUCTION\\nNeurocritical care has been classified as a subspecialty of neurology that primarily focuses\\non critical care for neurologically ill patients and neurological care for critically ill pa-\\ntients.1 Previous studies have found that providing neurocritical care services may improve\\nclinical outcomes in critically ill patients with neurological diseases, including traumatic\\nbrain injury, intracerebral hemorrhage, and subarachnoid hemorrhage.2-6 Social awareness\\nabout patient safety has also increased the awareness about high-quality neurocritical care\\namong patients and neurologists. Having a neurointensivist staff member and organizing\\nthe intensive care unit (ICU) infrastructure are crucially important for providing adequate\\ncare to neurocritically ill patients.7,8 However, there is currently a lack of full-time neuroin-\\ntensivists in Korean hospitals despite the presence of neurological, neurosurgical, or general\\nICUs in most general hospitals.9 To our knowledge, the effects of full-time neurointensivist\\nstaffing in a dedicated neurological intensive care unit (NRICU)—which may comprise a\\ndifferent patient population than a neurosurgical ICU, a combined neurological and neuro-\\nMyung-Ah Ko\\na*\\nJung Hwa Lee\\na*\\nJoong-Goo Kim\\na,b\\nSuyeon Jeong\\na\\nDong-Wha Kang\\na\\nChae-Man Lim\\nc\\nSang-Ahm Lee\\na\\nKwang-Kuk Kim\\na\\nSang-Beom Jeon\\na\\na\\x07Departments of Neurology and\\nc\\x07Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine,\\nAsan Medical Center, University of Ulsan\\nCollege of Medicine, Seoul, Korea\\nb\\x07Department of Neurology,\\nJeju National University Hospital,\\nJeju, Korea\\npISSN 1738-6586 / eISSN 2005-5013 / J Clin Neurol 2019;15(3):360-368 / https://doi.org/10.3988/jcn.2019.15.3.360\\nReceived\\nNovember 7, 2018\\nRevised\\nFebruary 25, 2019\\nAccepted\\nFebruary 25, 2019\\nCorrespondence\\nSang-Beom Jeon, MD, PhD\\nDepartment of Neurology,\\nAsan Medical Center,\\nUniversity of Ulsan College of Medicine,\\n88 Olympic-ro 43-gil, Songpa-gu,\\nSeoul 05505, Korea\\nTel +82-2-3010-3440\\nFax +82-2-474-4691\\nE-mail sbjeonmd@gmail.com\\n*These authors contributed equally to\\nthis work.\\ncc This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Com-\\nmercial License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0) which permits unrestricted non-commercial\\nuse, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\\nJCN Open Access\\nORIGINAL ARTICLE\\nwww.thejcn.com 361\\nKo MA et al.

Patients were included in the current\\nstudy if they were admitted to the NRICU of the Department\\nof Neurology at Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea between\\nMarch 1, 2010 and February 28, 2016. Patients were exclud-\\ned if they were younger than 18 years, did not have medical\\nrecords available for analysis in this study, or if brain death was\\ndeclared before admission to the NRICU. Two time periods\\nwere defined according to the appointment of a neurointen-\\nsivist: the before period (from March 1, 2010 to February 28,\\n2013) and the after period (from March 1, 2013 to February\\n28, 2016). This study was approved by the Institutional Re-\\nview Boards, and the need for written informed consent was\\nwaived because of the retrospective design of the study (IRB\\nNo. 2016-0379).\\nInfrastructure and staffing of the NRICU\\nThe NRICU of Asan Medical Center includes 13 beds, 7.5\\nof which are formally assigned to patients admitted to the\\nDepartment of Neurology. When critically ill patients are\\nadmitted to the Department of Neurology, they are admit-\\nted routinely to the NRICU. During the before period, these\\npatients were managed by neurology residents, neurology\\nfellows, and attending neurologists, and elective consulta-\\ntions with general intensivists were performed as necessary\\n(open-type ICU). A full-time neurointensivist (S.-B.J.) was\\nappointed on March 1, 2013, after which neurology patients\\nin the NRICU were managed by neurology residents and this\\nneurointensivist. Patient care in the NRICU was transferred\\nto the neurointensivist (closed-type ICU). For 92 patients with\\nseizures or status epilepticus, the neurointensivist provided\\nmandatory comanagement with attending neurologists; such\\nmanagement was transferred completely to the neurointensiv-\\nist after January 2016. The neurointensivist was also responsi-\\nble for every consultation to the Department of Neurology\\nfor patients with a neurological problem during admission\\nto general ICUs. In addition, the neurointensivist covered one\\nsession per week of the outpatient neurology clinic, where he\\nfollowed up patients discharged from the NRICU and patients\\npreviously consulted at general ICUs. There were no other\\nchanges to the nurse staffing and infrastructure of the NRICU\\nduring the 6-year period of the current study. The characteris-\\ntics of the NRICU infrastructure are compared between the\\ntwo time periods in Table 1.\\nThe neurointensivist introduced protocols for use in the\\nNRICU, including barbiturate coma therapy, targeted tem-\\nperature management, measurement and management of\\nintracranial pressure, osmotherapy, management of malig-\\nnant infarctions, evaluation of brain death, evaluation and\\nmanagement of meningoencephalitis, and evaluation and\\nmanagement of comatose restoration of spontaneous circu-\\nlation after cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The neurointen-\\nsivist held regular sessions to educate neurology residents and\\nNRICU nurses regarding these protocols and general issues\\nrelated to neurocritical care.\\nData collection\\nElectronic medical record and medical cost data were que-\\nried by the Information Technology Service Management of\\nAsan Medical Center for all patients admitted to the NRICU\\nduring the study period. Data were obtained on demo-\\ngraphics, comorbidities, vital signs, laboratory tests, medi-\\ncations, procedure records, complications, and clinical sta-\\ntus (severity of illness) on admission, including scores on\\nthe Glasgow Coma Scale and Acute Physiology and Chron-\\nic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II). Additional patient\\ninformation and formal reports on imaging investigations\\nwere retrieved from the electronic medical records and the\\npicture archiving and communication system, respectively.\\nInformation on the survival status up to 6 months after ad-\\nmission to the NRICU was obtained from the electronic\\nmedical records. Hospital-acquired pneumonia and cathe-\\nter-associated urinary tract infection were defined in accor-\\ndance with international guidelines.13,15 Venous thrombo-\\nembolism was diagnosed when computed tomography and/\\nor ultrasonography revealed a thrombus in the venous struc-\\n362 J Clin Neurol 2019;15(3):360-368\\nAppointing a Full-Time Neurointensivist\\nJCN\\ntures. Gastrointestinal bleeding was diagnosed in an endos-\\ncopy examination. The predicted in-hospital mortality rate\\nwas calculated based on the APACHE II score.16\\nNeurology consultations, inter-ICU transfers, family\\nsatisfaction, and medical costs\\nThe number of neurology consultations was assessed from\\ngeneral ICUs and the number of intrahospital inter-ICU\\ntransfers. Transfers were categorized into transfers from\\ngeneral ICUs (nonneurology departments) to the NRICU\\n(neurology department) and transfers from the NRICU to\\ngeneral ICUs. The current study regarded the numbers of\\nneurology consultations and inter-ICU transfers from gener-\\nal ICUs to the NRICU as proxies for the satisfaction of gen-\\neral intensivists (nonneurologists) with the neurological\\nservice provided by neurologists during the before period or\\nby a neurointensivist during the after period.\\nA hospital customer-satisfaction team conducted a patient-\\nfamily satisfaction survey regularly (twice yearly) throughout\\nthe 6-year study period. This survey consisted of a face-to-\\nface interview with 30 families of patients admitted to the\\nNRICU who were chosen randomly by the team. The ques-\\ntionnaire comprised one item assessing the general satisfaction\\nwith medical services in the NRICU and four items assessing\\nopinions about physicians (neurologists or a neurointensivist),\\nincluding their kindness, trust, explanations, and availability\\nfor family meetings. Each item of the questionnaire was rated\\non a 5-point scale, with the lowest score representing dissat-\\nisfaction and the highest score representing satisfaction.\\nTotal medical costs incurred during the hospital stays were\\ncalculated for the two study periods. They were organized\\ninto cost per year and cost per patient, with the latter further\\ncategorized into deductible and nondeductible costs.\\nStatistical analysis\\nData are presented as median and interquartile range (IQR)\\nvalues for continuous variables and as number and percent-\\nage values for categorical variables. Baseline characteristics\\n(demographics, comorbidities, diagnosis, and severity of ill-\\nness), clinical management, quality indicators, clinical out-\\ncomes, the number of neurology consultations, the number of\\ninter-ICU transfers, and the family satisfaction scores were\\ncompared between before and after appointing a full-time\\nneurointensivist.

Of these, 1,057 and 1,229\\npatients were admitted to the NRICU during the before and\\nafter periods, respectively. Sixty-two patients who were ad-\\nmitted to the NRICU during the before period were excluded\\nfor the following reasons: younger than 18 years (9 patients),\\nmedical records unavailable due to transfer to the Depart-\\nment of Psychiatry (3 patients), and hospital readmission to\\nthe NRICU (50 patients). Likewise, 25 patients who were\\nadmitted to the NRICU during the after period were ex-\\ncluded for the following reasons: younger than 18 years (3\\npatients), medical records unavailable (2 patients), hospital\\nreadmission to the NRICU (18 patients), and brain death\\ndeclared prior to admission to the NRICU (2 patients). The\\nremaining 2,199 patients were included in the final analysis,\\ncomprising 995 (13.2%) during the before period and 1,204\\n(15.7%) during the after period. Accordingly, the number of\\npatients who were admitted to the NRICU increased by 21%\\nafter appointing a neurointensivist (p<0.001). The 2,199 pa-\\ntients included 1,354 (61.6%) men.

The total median medical cost per patient was\\n10,993,897 won during the before period and 9,914,534 won\\nduring the after period (p=0.001).

Thus, both the medi-\\ncal cost per patient paid by the patients themselves and that\\npaid by the National Health Insurance Corporation decreased\\nsignificantly after appointing a neurointensivist (Table 6).\\nDISCUSSION\\nWe investigated the effect of appointing a full-time neuroin-\\ntensivist to manage a closed-type NRICU.

Rather, the decrease in length of stay al-\\nlowed significantly more admissions to the NRICU (which\\nincreased by 21%), which demonstrates the more efficient\\nutilization of NRICU beds. Furthermore, the in-hospital and\\n6-month mortality rates showed decreasing tendencies, from\\n5.6% to 4.6% and from 14.7% to 12.4%, respectively, but these\\nchanges were not statistically significant.

Inter-ICU trans-\\nfers from the NRICU to general ICUs decreased, whereas\\nthose from general ICUs to the NRICU increased. The pa-\\ntient families also reported an increase in general satisfac-\\ntion regarding the medical services provided by physicians\\n(neurologists or a neurointensivist) during admission to the\\nNRICU. Moreover, the medical cost for each patient incurred\\nduring the hospital admission and paid either by patients or\\nthe National Health Insurance Corporation decreased signif-\\nicantly. However, the total medical costs paid to the hospital\\nincreased due to the number of patients increasing. Thus, the\\ncurrent study suggests that appointing a full-time neurointen-\\nsivist in a preexisting NRICU improves the quality of care\\nand outcomes for neurocritically ill patients.\\nThe in-hospital mortality rate in the current study decreased\\nby 1% after implementing a full-time neurointensivist; that\\nis, 1 more of every 100 neurocritically ill patients survived\\nafter this change. However, this finding did not reach statis-\\ntical significance, which is probably due to the sample size\\nbeing insufficient and the already low mortality rate of the\\npreexisting NRICU infrastructure of the study hospital. Alter-\\nnatively, the lower mortality in the current study compared\\nwith previous studies may have been due to differences in\\nthe study populations: patients with traumatic brain injury,\\nintracerebral hemorrhage, and subarachnoid hemorrhage\\nwho are admitted to a neurosurgical ICU or a combined neu-\\nrological and neurosurgical ICU generally have a higher\\nmortality rate than patients with ischemic stroke and other\\nneurological diseases.17,18 The observed in-hospital mortality\\nrate was below that expected based on APACHE II score\\nduring both the before period (5.6% vs. 9.8%) and the after\\nperiod (4.6% vs. 9.7%), respectively. The decrease in the\\n6-month mortality rate may be related to the beneficial ef-\\nfects provided by having a neurointensivist in the NRICU\\nbecause appropriate care during the critical phase of illness\\nmay improve the long-term outcomes of patients.19 Our find-\\nings suggest that appointing a neurointensivist and changing\\nthe organization of an NRICU from an open type to a closed\\ntype can reduce patient mortality. However, this interpreta-\\ntion requires confirmation since this was a single-center study\\nand our findings did not reach statistical significance.\\nStudies assessing the satisfaction of general intensivists\\nand the families of patients in the NRICU are lacking. We\\nconsidered the number of neurology consultations and in-\\nter-ICU transfers as proxies for the satisfaction of general in-\\ntensivists who were working in nonneurology ICUs with the\\nperformance of neurologists or the neurointensivist. These\\nproxies were used because no data from prospective surveys\\nof coworkers were available, and a survey initiated during the\\nafter period could be affected by recall bias. The number of\\nneurology consultations from general ICUs and inter-ICU\\ntransfers from general ICUs to the NRICU increased after\\nappointing a neurointensivist. This could be interpreted as\\nindicating that the satisfaction of general intensivists with the\\nneurology service provided by the neurointensivist increased\\ncompared to the service provided by neurologists. Alterna-\\ntively, the decrease in the number of inter-ICU transfers from\\nthe NRICU to general ICUs might be related to the compe-\\ntence of a closed-type NRICU run by a neurointensivist. To\\nassess the satisfaction of the families of patients, the results\\nof the prospective survey performed during the before peri-\\nod and the after period were available for the current study.\\nThese results showed that the general satisfaction of patient\\nfamilies with critical care in the NRICU and with how the\\nphysicians performed increased after appointing a neuroin-\\ntensivist. Thus, having a neurointensivist staff member might\\nalso satisfy the general intensivists by managing neurological\\nproblems occurring in general ICUs and satisfy the patient\\nfamilies by providing improved critical care in the NRICU.\\nOur study was subject to some limitations.

JCN\\ncenter retrospective study inherently has a risk of selection\\nbias, and so the results of our study might not be broadly ap-\\nplicable to other centers. The NRICU of our hospital was sep-\\narate from the neurosurgical ICU, and the current study was\\ndesigned to evaluate patients admitted to the NRICU. Thus,\\nmost patients who presented with traumatic brain injury, in-\\ntracerebral hemorrhage, and subarachnoid hemorrhage were\\nnot included in the current study. In addition, the infrastruc-\\nture and environment of a hospital, and the training back-\\nground, capability, and working environment of the neuroin-\\ntensivist may affect the study results. Second, the quality of\\ncritical care and clinical outcomes might have improved due\\nto either appointing a neurointensivist or the availability of\\nnew advanced medical technology, given that the study period\\nwas 6 years. Improved family satisfaction could also be due\\nto both the neurointensivist and hospital-wide efforts to pro-\\nvide better medical care for hospitalized patients. Likewise,\\nwe interpreted the numbers of neurology consultations and\\ninter-ICU transfers from general ICUs to the NRICU as prox-\\nies for the satisfaction of our coworking general intensivists,\\nbut increases in these numbers might not directly represent\\nincreased satisfaction. Third, the clinical outcomes of the pa-\\ntients were defined using the survival rate rather than func-\\ntional outcomes because the latter data were not available\\nfor the current retrospective study. The mortality rate may\\nbe an inadequate parameter for evaluating the clinical out-\\ncomes of neurocritically ill patients. Fourth, the satisfaction\\nof neurology residents and nurses regarding the education\\nthey received about neurocritical care and management in\\nthe NRICU was not investigated, because none of the residents\\nand only a small proportion of the nurses were employed in\\nthe NRICU throughout the 6-year study period. Fifth, the\\nprofessional burnout of the neurointensivist was not as-\\nsessed. Although the current study showed that appointing a\\nneurointensivist was associated with improvements in quality\\nindicators and patient outcomes, running a closed-type NRI-\\nCU for a prolonged period with a single neurointensivist\\nmay eventually lead to negative impacts on patient care and\\nsafety due to neurointensivist burnout.20\\nIn conclusion, appointing a full-time neurointensivist and\\nimplementing organizational changes for running a closed-\\ntype NRICU have beneficial effects on quality indicators of\\ncritical care, patient outcomes, and satisfaction of general in-\\ntensivists and patient families. However, the present results\\nshould not be interpreted as evidence that appointing a single\\nneurointensivist is sufficient to run a closed-type NRICU.\\nGiven the shortage of neurointensivists in Korea, hospital\\nadministrative efforts should also be made to prevent profes-\\nsional burnout and enable shift work for neurointensivists.\\nConflicts of Interest\\nThe authors have no potential conflicts of interest to disclose.',\n",
       " 'Introduction\\nAdmission to an intensive care unit (ICU) is often a sudden, devastating, and life-threatening\\nevent. Discharge from the ICU marks the end of this hyperacute phase, but is just the\\nbeginning of the recovery journey for many patients and their informal caregivers.\\nCritical care advances have meant that more patients are surviving their critical care illness\\n(CCI) [1]. Until recently, the primary focus during hospitalization was on physiological\\nparameters and markers of recovery (e.g., vital sign stability). However, CCI affects\\nsurvivors’ and caregivers’ health in unanticipated ways [2]. Survivors often suffer from new\\nor worsened physical, cognitive, and emotional sequelae despite making good recovery of\\ntheir CCI; informal caregivers can experience substantial emotional distress. These CCI-\\nrelated sequelae—termed post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) and PICS-family (PICS-F)\\nby the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) [3]—often become chronic and increase\\nrisk for morbidity and mortality [3–5].\\nTraditionally, PICS and PICS-F have been considered distinct from the sequelae observed in\\nsurvivors of acute brain injuries (ABI; e.g., traumatic brain injury, TBI; stroke). In order to\\navoid the confounding effect of the neurological injury on the classical symptoms of PICS,\\nthe neurocritical care population has largely been excluded from “PICS”-related research,\\nand neurocritical care physicians have largely been absent from the SCCM PICS stakeholder\\nconferences regarding development and dissemination of information.\\nThe main goal of this paper is to familiarize healthcare providers with PICS and how it\\nmight relate to our patients and their informal caregivers. We begin by concisely reviewing\\nthe PICS and PICS-F literature in the non-neurosciences population to provide a general\\nunderstanding of PICS as an acquired phenomenon in the absence of known neurological\\ninjury. Next, we review the additional impact of neurological injury on cognitive, physical,\\nand emotional outcomes among neurocritical care patients and families, address challenges\\nin studying PICS in this population, and discuss ways to advance the science of recovery\\namong critically ill patients and their families.\\nPICS and PICS-F in Critical Care Patients Without Acute Brain Injury\\nPhysical Effects of Critical Illness\\nThe most common CCI-related physical impairment is weakness. This includes critical\\nillness polyneuropathy and/or myopathy, which occurs in at least a quarter of medical ICU\\n(MICU)/surgical ICU survivors without preexisting neuromuscular disease [4], and has\\nassociated pathological changes [5]. The acquired weakness is independently associated\\nwith multiorgan failure (e.g., severe sepsis), sedation, pharmacological (e.g., steroid)\\ntreatment, and prolonged mechanical ventilation (> 4–7 days) [5, 6]. Joint contractures can\\nLaBuzetta et al.\\nPage 2\\nNeurocrit Care.

These physical impairments increase in-\\nhospital morbidity and also mortality at one year [8].\\nCognitive Effects of Critical Illness\\nProlonged cognitive impairment is common among survivors of CCI and occurs with a\\nfrequency greater than expected when compared with normative data. The most commonly\\nreported domains of cognitive impairment are attention, executive functioning/verbal\\nfluency, visual and working memory, and visuospatial skills [9–12]. Several high-quality\\nprospective studies are worth mentioning.\\nThe Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a national cohort of individuals > 50 years,\\nshowed that among 516 surviving respondents with incident sepsis from the HRS, only 6.1%\\nhad moderate-to-severe cognitive impairment prior to incident sepsis, with that number\\nincreasing to nearly 17% afterward [13]. Similarly, among previously unimpaired MICU\\npatients younger than 55 who require mechanical ventilation, 32% show cognitive\\nimpairment in 2 or more cognitive domains 6 months later [9], without any newly\\nappreciated in-hospital neurological injury to explain these new impairments.\\nIn another large, single-center cohort of 821 patients, 40% of the patients had global\\ncognition scores that were similar to scores of patients with moderate TBI (1.5 SD below the\\npopulation mean), while approximately 25% of individuals had cognitive performance\\nscores similar to patients with mild Alzheimer’s disease (2 SD below the population mean)\\nat 3 months post-discharge. At 12 months, these numbers were 34% and 24% [13] indicating\\nsome improvement, though a clinically significant number of individuals still do not reach\\nnear-normative values [14]. Moreover, these ICU admissions do not need to be long-lasting\\nfor onset of short-term and long-term cognitive difficulty; in the Sukantarat et al. [14] study,\\npatients needed to be admitted to the ICU for only 72 hours to be included.\\nDespite a lack of any known neurological injury in these critically ill patients, there does\\nseem to be an anatomic correlation for these new cognitive deficits. Computed tomography\\nhead imaging reveals significant atrophy in acute respiratory distress syndrome survivors\\ncompared with age- and sex-matched controls [15]. Using magnetic resonance imaging,\\nVISIONS researchers noted brain atrophy in the frontal lobes and hippocampi of CCI\\nsurvivors, as well as decreased fractional anisotropy scores (a marker of white matter\\nintegrity) in the corpus callosum and anterior limb of the internal capsule using diffusion\\ntensor imaging at 3-month follow-up [11, 16]. These volume and white matter changes\\ncorrelated with delirium duration, and the white matter changes further correlated with\\ncognitive impairment at 12 months.\\nPsychiatric Effects of Critical Illness in Patients and Caregivers\\nSymptoms of depression, post-traumatic stress (PTSD), and anxiety are common after CCI\\nand often become chronic, negatively impacting physical recovery and increasing risk for\\nmorbidity and mortality. Lasting neuropsychiatric effects may also occur in patients’\\ninformal caregivers, up to years following a loved one’s illness [17–19], and appear related\\nto the patient’s post-ICU disability [20, 21] but independent of whether the patient survived\\n[21]. These effects then impact caregivers’ own health-related quality of life [22].\\nLaBuzetta et al.\\nPage 3\\nNeurocrit Care.

Since admission to the ICU is\\noften sudden and life-threatening, many patients develop post-traumatic stress (PTS)\\nsymptoms that can transition to PTSD. Caregivers who witness life-threatening CCI can also\\ndevelop PTSD [24–26].\\nSymptoms of PTS are seen following medical, cardiovascular, surgical, trauma, and burn\\nCCI [27, 28], encompassing a host of diagnoses (e.g., respiratory failure, sepsis, cardiac\\narrest). The prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder in CCI survivors is high and persists\\nover time [29]. More than 75% of mixed ICU patients referred for neuropsychological\\nevaluation report at least one stressful in-ICU experience (e.g., nightmares, severe pain,\\nbreathing difficulty, or a feeling of suffocation) [30]. A recent meta-analysis in 36 unique\\ncohorts of patients surviving critical illness found a pooled prevalence of PTSD of 25–44%\\nat 6 months depending on the severity cutoff used for the Impact of Event Scale [31]. At\\none-year follow-up, PTSD symptoms are still reported in upwards of 20% of survivors [31].\\nRates of PTSD in caregivers of CCI survivors range between 11.1 and 57.1% depending on\\nthe instrument used and timepoint of assessment [18, 20, 22, 24, 32]. These high prevalence\\nrates are corroborated by studies using the PTSD Checklist for DSM-V (PCL-V), which has\\na high concordance with diagnostic interviews [33].\\nDepression—There are similar clinical risk factors for depression as for other psychiatric\\ndisorders, for example, hypoglycemia [34], sepsis [21], and acute respiratory distress\\nsyndrome (ARDS) [12, 35]. Some researchers have noted a long-lasting comorbidity\\nbetween CCI-associated depression and PTSD [36].\\nIn a large, multicenter study investigating neuropsychological health after critical illness, the\\nreported prevalence of depression was high at 37% (N = 406) [4]. In patients with no\\npreexisting history of depression, depressive symptoms still occur in nearly 30% at 12\\nmonths and are even higher in patients with preexisting depression. At five years, prevalence\\nis still nearly 20% in a multicenter cohort study of ARDS survivors [37]. Smaller cohorts\\nhave a wider range of rates of depression, though they are still significantly higher than the\\ngeneral population prevalence of < 10% [12, 38, 39]. Similarly, rates of depression in\\ncaregivers range between 4.7 and 36% [17, 18, 20, 24].\\nAnxiety—Anxiety has been less studied. Published rates of anxiety most often use the\\nHospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (anxiety subscale) questionnaire, and, in general,\\nrange from 16 to 24% in long-term survivors of CCI, though rates as high as 62% have been\\nreported [12, 29, 35]. These prevalence rates of anxiety are higher than the general\\npopulation [39], and there are no differences in prevalence between medical, surgical, and\\ntrauma ICU patients even a year after discharge [29]. Caregivers experience anxiety with\\nrates similar to patients (15–25%) [24].\\nRisk Factors as Defined in Non-Neurocritical Population\\nSeveral risk factors interact with CCI to contribute to the development of PICS and PICS-F\\nwith subsequent decreased health-related quality of life (see Fig. 1).\\nLaBuzetta et al.\\nPage 4\\nNeurocrit Care. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2020 June 01.\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nNon-Modifiable Factors—Younger patients may be at higher risk for PTSD [27, 40, 41].\\nFemale gender is regularly reported as a risk factor for depression in both patients and\\nfamily members following CCI [21, 30, 35]. One of the most robust predictors of PICS- or\\nPICS-F-related psychiatric illness is lifetime history of mental illness [18, 20, 34–36, 42],\\nwith a relative risk of 3.9 (95% CI 1.5–6.5) [34]. Prior cognitive impairment is also a risk\\nfactor for post-ICU worsened cognitive function [43].\\nModifiable Factors: Sedation, Delirium and Agitation, and Length of Stay—The\\npathophysiological relationship between sedation, delirium, and cognitive impairment is\\nmultifactorial and outside the scope of this paper, but sedation and delirium may impact\\nfuture development of PICS.\\nWith delirium, patients can experience psychotic symptoms, and delusional memories of an\\nICU admission predict PTSD, so delirium may be a risk factor [27]. Additionally, in\\nhundreds of patients enrolled in the BRAIN-ICU study, a longer duration of delirium was\\nindependently associated with both worsened global cognitive and executive function [13].\\nA British pathology-based study reported that the odds ratio for developing dementia at > 85\\nyears old was 8.7 in patients with delirium [44], and in patients without prior cognitive\\nimpairment, this incident dementia was not mediated by traditional neuropathological\\nchanges. If delusional, fragmented memories contribute to PTSD, then processing those\\nmemories may decrease the vulnerability to developing PTSD. ICU diaries used to address\\nmemory gaps have shown benefits (mostly in single-center trials) in PICS and PICS-F in\\nEurope, Canada, and the USA [45–49] with a large prospective multicenter trial ongoing in\\nFrance [50].\\nData on the relationship between sedation and PICS are mixed. Several studies have reported\\na relationship between benzodiazepine sedation and PICS [34, 40, 42, 51]. One study\\nreported increased relative risk of depression in patients with a mean daily ICU\\nbenzodiazepine dose > 100 mg of midazolam-equivalent agent [34], and another noted\\nincreased PTSD with larger total dose of lorazepam [40]. This correlation was not seen in\\nthe larger BRAIN-ICU cohort [13], which was completed more recently and may reflect a\\ngrowing interest in sedation reduction [52, 53]. It may be that the higher doses of sedation—\\nand in particular benzodiazepines and opiates, rather than propofol and dexmedetomidine\\n[40, 42, 54]—or lack of sedation holidays are more detrimental to downstream cognitive\\nimpairment and mental illness, especially PTSD [31, 42, 55]. Kress and colleagues\\nsuggested daily sedation holidays until a patient is reliably following commands or\\nuncomfortable/agitated [52]. Conversely, agitation or placement of restraints (especially\\nwithout sedation) is a risk factor for PICS [42, 54]. This agitation may be a marker or\\nprodrome of PTS, and benzodiazepines might reflect the management of this anxiety/\\nagitation [27].\\nLength of stay (LOS) is another risk factor for PICS and a significant predictor of PTSD\\n[56]. Mechanical ventilation [41], a longer time to develop delirium, and immobility [7] are\\nlikely a few mediators of this risk rather than severity of illness [14, 38, 40, 41].\\nLaBuzetta et al.\\nPage 5\\nNeurocrit Care. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2020 June 01.\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nPICS and PICS-F in Patients with Acute Brain Injury\\nWithin the neurointensive care unit (NeuroICU), research on PICS is emerging. It is well\\nknown that certain neurological diagnoses are associated with neurocognitive changes, for\\ninstance stroke [57, 58]. However, many disorders are heterogenous, with only a fraction of\\npatients experiencing associated CCI; admission to the NeuroICU is more complicated than\\nhaving a specific diagnosis. To the extent that neurological diagnoses do not universally\\nrequire intensive care, these studies are not pertaining to PICS (or PICS-like) effects. This\\napproach is not errant; however, it negates the effect that CCI can have on the trajectory of\\ndisease and recovery. PICS is related to the experience of critical illness.\\nWith that limitation in mind, some diagnoses often include a portion of their hospital stay in\\nthe ICU: status epilepticus (SE), malignant cerebral edema following ischemic stroke,\\naneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH), non-traumatic intracerebral hemorrhage\\n(ICH), and moderate-to-severe TBI. We will focus on these ABI diagnoses here.\\nStatus Epilepticus\\nSE can be either convulsive or non-convulsive (NCSE); it is considered a risk factor for\\nfuture cognitive impairment [59]. In a retrospective study of outcomes following NCSE,\\napproximately 15% of patients evidenced new cognitive impairment; however, it is unclear if\\nsome of these neurocognitive changes were related to the NCSE itself, the underlying trigger\\nfor NCSE, or medication effects [60]. The same research group found that SE patients\\nperformed poorer than controls on memory, learning, and executive functioning tasks; the\\nSE patients also performed significantly worse on tests of motor latency than did patients\\nwith > 10 lifetime seizures (but never SE) [59].\\nIschemic Stroke\\nAdmission to the ICU following stroke depends on severity and treatment history. However,\\nmalignant edema from ischemic stroke is often treated in the ICU. In a case series evaluating\\nlong-term outcomes following decompressive hemicraniectomy in these patients, we see that\\n100% evidenced impairments in multiple cognitive domains and 40% endorsed clinically\\nsignificant depressive symptoms [61]. When asked directly, 80% of patients considered\\nsurgery as a favorable course of action despite these deficits; 20% had aphasia too severe to\\nanswer for themselves. Similar multi-domain cognitive dysfunction has been reported in less\\ndetail elsewhere in a retrospective study with a larger cohort [62].\\nNon-Traumatic ICH\\nIn the multicenter, double-blind FAST trial, researchers noted a high prevalence of\\ndepression (20%) that independently and negatively impacted quality of life (QoL) [63].\\nClinical severity and disability appear to impact development of depression [63]. Taking all\\nnon-traumatic ICH together, one study found a prevalence of depression and anxiety of 23%\\nand 8%, respectively, in 48 patients who presented for formal neuropsychological\\nassessment; cognitive impairment (memory > psychomotor > executive functioning >\\nlanguage > visuospatial) was noted in 77%, and 13% met criteria for dementia [64]. This\\neffect may be further exacerbated by delirium and agitation, as seen in a prospective study\\nLaBuzetta et al.\\nPage 6\\nNeurocrit Care. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2020 June 01.\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nmeasuring Neuro-QoL scores up to 1 year after surviving ICH [65]. Within the prospective\\nPITCH cohort, 37% without preexisting dementia showed cognitive decline following their\\nICH, which was associated with severity of cortical atrophy [66]. A separate single-center\\nstudy investigated early versus late incident dementia in ICH and found that different risk\\nfactors were influential at different times during recovery [67].\\nAneurysmal SAH\\nIn a single-center study of 111 patients, 95% reported at least one subjective cognitive or\\nemotional complaint that affected everyday life [68]. The most commonly cited objective\\ncognitive impairments in aSAH are related to attention, memory, and executive functioning\\ndespite reports of “good outcomes” on traditional measures (e.g., Modified Rankin) [69–71];\\nin the large, multicenter prospective ISAT trial cohort, 32% of patients with a “good\\noutcome” had cognitive impairment (performance at < 5%ile in ≥ 2 cognitive domains) [72]\\n—rates of neuropsychological impairment similar to prior studies [73, 74]. We also see a\\nhigh prevalence of depression (23– 44%) in aSAH patients [69, 75–78]. In combination with\\ncognitive impairment, these emotional complaints contribute to decreased health-related\\nQoL and inability to return to work [72, 75, 79]. In studies that have prospectively\\ninvestigated it, reported rates of anxiety and PTSD after aSAH are > 30% and > 35%,\\nrespectively [76, 78, 79]. Additionally, even in perimesencephalic SAH—which is thought\\nto have a good prognosis—approximately one-quarter of patients (N = 39) could not return\\nto work in a prospective study over 8 years [80]; this was attributed to new\\nneuropsychological changes and fatigue [69, 80, 81].\\nTraumatic Brain Injury\\nFocusing on civilian studies of moderate/severe TBI, cognitive dysfunction has an\\ninconsistent pattern of cognitive impairment [82]. Moreover, these neuropsychological\\nchanges evolve over time with different risk factors at different times [83]. In querying the\\nTraumatic Brain Injury Model Systems dataset, researchers reported an age-related impact\\non decline after TBI, with patients > 26 years having an increased likelihood of decline than\\nyounger patients (16–26) [84]. At in-person 4-year follow-up of over 100 patients from the\\nParis-TBI cohort with severe TBI, cognitive complaints were noted in up to 68%; 43% had\\nanxiety and 25% were noted to have depression despite nearly 80% of the cohort being\\nindependent in ADLs [85] and more than 33% being gainfully employed [86]. A separate\\nsingle-center cohort of 108 moderate-to-severe patients without intracranial hemorrhage\\nfound high rates of new cognitive impairment (52%), clinically significant depression\\n(40%), and PTSD (26%), without a relationship seen between severity of injury and\\ncognitive outcomes [38].\\nThese data should indicate that our neurocritical patients may survive their CCI yet continue\\nto have unmet needs. It appears that PICS (or a PICS-like phenomenon) exists, but the\\nneurological literature uses a different language to describe it. Moreover, there is a\\ndistinction between the disease-related neurocognitive changes and the neurocognitive\\nchanges associated with the hospitalization. As illustrated in the non-neurological critical\\ncare population, the neuropsychiatric effects of critical illness appear to represent a separate\\nLaBuzetta et al.\\nPage 7\\nNeurocrit Care.

In neurocritical care, perhaps this experiential injury is over and above\\nthat of the primary neurological injury.\\nChallenges of Addressing PICS in Neurocritical Care Patients\\nThere is a fundamental difficulty in addressing PICS in the NeuroICU population, though\\nour patient population may be at a high risk of developing PICS-like symptoms.\\nPrimary Brain Injury\\nNeuroICU patients are admitted with ABI, sometimes in addition to other diagnoses known\\nto be implicated in PICS (e.g., sepsis). Unfortunately, this new neurological injury makes it\\nprofoundly difficult to study PICS in this population since differentiating new\\nneuropsychological changes related to primary neurological injury from symptoms related to\\ncritical illness is near impossible. Although studies using functional MRI can identify\\ngeneral locations involved in cognitive functioning, it is artificial to try to conclude that a\\nnew neuropsychological deficit can be attributed to a particular lesion rather than critical\\nillness. It is more straightforward to attribute new neuropsychological findings to known\\nbrain injury, and this may leave PICS unattended in the NeuroICU population.\\nIn addition, many neurological injuries leave patients with new neurological symptoms (e.g.,\\naphasia, impaired decision-making, and decreased arousal) that may make it difficult to\\nstudy patients’ mental health using common methods (e.g., surveys). As providers, we need\\nto tailor our assessment and treatments for individual ability to participate.\\nAlthough ABI makes it harder to understand PICS in our patient population, it also makes it\\nmore important to identify ways of studying our patient population’s risk. Some\\nneuropsychological changes are related to ABI, but it is possible that there is additional\\nimpairment related to the experience of CCI itself. The interrelationship among biological\\nand psychological factors challenges our understanding of new neuropsychological\\nimpairment because there may be a component of post-NeuroICU impairment that is\\npreventable based on an understanding of PICS pathophysiology and risk factors.\\nProlonged Sedation\\nSedation holidays and daily awakenings show benefit in mitigating neuropsychological\\nimpairment [52, 55], but patients in the NeuroICU often have pathologies that preclude\\nweaning of sedation. For instance, management escalation often necessitates anesthetic\\ninfusions and cerebral suppression using propofol, benzodiazepines, or barbiturates in the\\ntreatment of status epilepticus, uncontrolled intracranial pressure, and severe drug or alcohol\\nwithdrawal [87–90]. Thus, relative to the medical ICU, the NeuroICU disproportionately has\\npatients who are not candidates for daily sedation interruption, which may increase the risk\\nfor neuropsychiatric sequelae.\\nLack of Noninvasive Monitoring\\nAlthough some diagnoses require prolonged cerebral suppression, in many cases attempts\\nare made to minimize sedation to optimize the neurological exam. This may affect our PICS\\npatients’ risk, however.\\nLaBuzetta et al.\\nPage 8\\nNeurocrit Care. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2020 June 01.\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nFirst, the Pain, Agitation, Delirium, Immobility and Sleep guidelines [91] are not adapted to\\na NeuroICU population. They recommend adjunctive non-opioid medications to reduce\\nsedation and opioid needs, for example ketamine, which can increase intracranial pressure,\\nthus being potentially detrimental in the NeuroICU. Neuropathic pain medications are also\\nrecommended, but their sedative and cognitive effects prevent their use in many neurological\\npatients [92].\\nSecondly, the neurological examination is the gold standard for noninvasive neuro-\\nmonitoring. Unlike the cardiac (i.e., telemetry) or pulmonary (i.e., O2 saturation) systems,\\nthe neurological system lacks a highly sensitive way to continuously and noninvasively\\nmonitor neuroclinical status. While continuous electroencephalography (EEG) is utilized in\\nthe NeuroICU, and quantitative EEG can offer information regarding changes in cerebral\\nactivity, these are not universally used nor relied upon to determine clinically significant\\nchanges. Thus, patients are examined every one to four hours. The sleep disturbances that\\noccur are an unfortunate corollary to frequently waking patients up for an interactive\\nexamination, often times for days in a row.\\nAlthough nebulous, the link between sleep and delirium is theorized to include common\\npathophysiologic pathways, shared mechanisms, shared neurotransmitters, or a potential\\ncause–effect relationship [93]. This is relevant because if our frequent neurological\\nexaminations are contributing to a heightened risk for delirium, then we may also be\\ncontributing to an increased risk of neuropsychological sequelae in our patient population.\\nFrightening Memories\\nFrightening and delusional memories are symptoms of acute distress, and several studies\\nhave also identified them as risk factors for post-CCI psychiatric symptoms including PTSD\\n[42, 51, 54, 56]. Some of the non-pharmacological mechanisms for preventing PTSD\\ninclude rest, minimal stimulation, and explanations of any procedure being performed no\\nmatter how minimal (e.g., suctioning, serial examinations). However, many neurological\\npatients have language impairment and struggle with comprehension. As such, routine care\\nmight be frightening, especially in someone who is unable to communicate or otherwise\\nencephalopathic.\\nMobility\\nEarly mobility is known to improve physical outcomes after critical illness [94–96] and may\\nalso have some positive effects on delirium [97]. Mobility challenges are complex in the\\nNeuroICU, though many of these complexities—such as appropriate staffing, availability of\\nphysical and occupational therapists, mechanical ventilation, prevalence of tubes and lines—\\nare shared with other ICU populations [98]. Many patients in the NeuroICU also have\\nexternal ventricular drains, lumbar drains, or other intracranial monitoring, which, though\\nnot a contraindication to mobility, add a degree of complexity. In addition, many patients\\nwith ABI also have motor impairment related to their primary injury, which may confound\\nearly mobility and rehabilitation efforts.\\nLaBuzetta et al.\\nPage 9\\nNeurocrit Care.

There is evidence to support a PICS-F\\nphenomenon [99–101], although the literature refers to it using different terminology. In a\\nprospective study investigating caregivers of patients with advanced neurological illness,\\nTrevick and Lord [102] found that signs of a traumatic response could be seen in 33% of\\ncaregivers at one month, with 17% of family members (N = 23) meeting criteria for PTSD at\\n6 months; these results were not explained by whether a patient died. The prevalence of\\ndepression and anxiety in family members has been reported as high as 8.6% and 20.7%,\\nrespectively, with no difference based on LOS [100]. Vranceanu et al. [103] conducted a\\nseries of cross-sectional and prospective studies showing that ineffective coping,\\nmindfulness [103], self-efficacy and social support [101], and the interpersonal patient–\\ncaregiver relationship [101] are important modifiable [104] factors associated with\\ndepression, anxiety, and PTS in patients and caregivers, and that early emotional distress\\ntends to remain chronic over time [33].\\nPerhaps, as a result of increased recognition of family and caregiver effects from\\nneurocritical illness, there has been an increased focus on family-centered care in the\\nNeuroICU. Hwang et al. [105] found increased satisfaction in families who participate in\\nfamily meetings and also identified areas for improvement in family satisfaction including\\nsupport during decision-making and control over the care of their loved ones. Shared\\ndecision-making also seems to be important; however, shared decision-making is difficult\\ndue to discordance between the kind of information decision-makers desire and that which is\\nprovided to them by physicians [106], as well as the limitations of decision aids available for\\nuse in the NeuroICU [107, 108]. No single intervention seems to be universally successful in\\npreventing PICS-F [109], and a recent article noted that recovery interventions aimed at the\\npatient alone are unsuccessful [110]. To recognize the importance of patient–family and\\npatient–caregiver dyads is to recognize the impact that psychosocial factors can make on\\nrecovery and neuropsychological outcomes for both the patient and their loved ones.\\nDiscussion\\nMillions of critical illness survivors are discharged every year, yet neither they nor their\\ninformal caregivers are prepared for the new challenges that await them [111], including\\nlengthy rehabilitation and new or worsened cognitive, psychiatric, and physical problems.\\nThese neuropsychological changes represent a CCI process that can be seen in the absence\\nof objective neurological injury, which is why understanding neurocognitive changes in the\\nnon-neurological population is critical. To the extent that the neurosciences population also\\nexperiences CCI, our patients’ outcomes may improve with increased prevention and\\ntreatment of this CCI-related injury. If one accepts that there are potential\\nneuropsychological effects of CCI, it raises the question: what are the next steps?\\nFirstly, in order to move this field of inquiry forward, we must reframe our expectations for\\nneurocritical care patients’ outcomes and better clarify the ways in which PICS is relevant in\\nthe NeuroICU (even though it may be difficult to parse out). Ultimately, a more complete\\nunderstanding of these neuropsychological outcomes will be required for an effective\\nLaBuzetta et al.\\nPage 10\\nNeurocrit Care.

To this end, the Neurocritical Care Society and Deutsche\\nGesellschaft für NeuroIntensivund Notfallmedizin held a joint session at Arbeitstagung\\nNeuroIntensivMedizin on the topic of “Post ICU Syndrome—what happens in the NICU …\\nstays with the patient” [112] with a position paper published [113]. Although critical care\\nphysicians are increasingly aware of PICS and PICS-F, there are many opportunities for\\nadvancing our understanding within neurocritical care (and with those providers who follow\\nour patients long-term). Limited awareness may lead to reduced quality of life [114].\\nAnother natural arena for collaboration with our non-neurosciences colleagues is to better\\nelucidate the mechanisms that underlie the constellation of neuropsychological symptoms\\nafflicting CCI survivors. One hypothesis is that patients with non-neurological critical illness\\nare actually experiencing new neurological injury related to systemic organ dysfunction, and\\nthis new injury is simply below the threshold of identification using current technology (for\\ninstance, there is emerging literature on the pathophysiology of cerebral dysfunction in\\nsepsis [115, 116] that could be built upon). Thus, investigation into the mechanism of PICS\\nin non-NeuroICU patients is an area where neurological expertise and collaboration may be\\nbeneficial, and it may help us to understand neuropsychological outcomes in our own\\nneurocritical patients. In this way, neurocritical care is an extension of critical care rather\\nthan a separate entity.\\nAdditionally, we need to have a better understanding of the prevalence of PICS-like\\noutcomes in NeuroICU patients. One goal is to identify modifiable and non-modifiable risk\\nfactors in order to detect patients at risk of neuropsychological sequelae, with interventions\\ndesigned to mitigate those risks. In some circumstances, this may require reassessing clinical\\ntrial results or landmark recommendations (e.g., pain, agitation, and delirium guidelines\\n[53], ABCDE bundles [117]) with attention paid to the NeuroICU population. For example,\\na trial is currently underway to evaluate the effects of non-sedation (versus sedation with a\\ndaily wake-up trial) on cognitive and physical outcomes [118]. Although some neurocritical\\npatients (e.g., those with status epilepticus or head trauma requiring therapeutic coma) will\\nbe excluded, neurological patients will not broadly be excluded. Moreover, when conducting\\ntrials, we propose keeping these neuropsychological outcomes in mind, because—all things\\nbeing equal—our patients and their families will likely prefer treatments that improve\\nquality of life [119]; “mortality rates alone are no longer a sufficient guide to quality of\\ncare” [120].\\nMore than any of the above, however, is potential for collaboration in addressing outcomes\\nin both patients (PICS) and their family members (i.e., PICS-F). Multidisciplinary post-ICU\\nclinics [2]—as in the THRIVE initiative—may be a valuable objective within neurocritical\\ncare. However, current efforts at preventive interventions for patients alone, without\\nincluding the caregiver, have not been successful in preventing chronic emotional distress in\\npatients [110]. Upon critical reflection, this makes sense given research showing that patient\\nand caregiver coping and emotional distress are interrelated and may travel together over\\ntime [121]. Many caregivers feel that they are not always understanding the needs of the\\npatient [122, 123], and this negatively impacts their mood and the care they provide [124,\\n125]. Additionally, the quality of care that a caregiver provides influences the trajectory of\\npsychiatric illness in patients [126–128]; for example, overprotection and patronization\\nLaBuzetta et al.\\nPage 11\\nNeurocrit Care.

Caregiver psychological distress also affects the\\nfunctional and psychosocial recovery of the patient [129, 130] (as well as medical costs\\ninsofar as caregivers’ poor mental health is associated with patients’ rehospitalization and\\nincreased health-related costs [131–133]). A recent systematic review from the American\\nHeart Association recommended that interventions during stroke recovery should be dyadic\\n(patient and caregiver together) and should address patient and caregiver outcomes (rather\\nthan just teaching caregivers how to help patients, or how to cope with caring for patients)\\n[134, 135]. We believe this dyadic framework is applicable to all NeuroICU diagnoses.\\nGiven that emotional distress at hospitalization is the best predictor of future emotional\\ndistress [31] in both patients and their families, a focus on prevention may be the most\\nefficient and effective way to improve outcomes in both patients and caregivers. The level of\\npatient involvement will depend on degree of neurologic impairment; for those with\\ncognitive deficits, skills such as mindfulness meditation can be emphasized. Early dyadic\\ninterventions starting at hospitalization and focusing on skills such as resiliency and\\ninterpersonal communication are underway in some institutions, including Massachusetts\\nGeneral Hospital’s “Recovering Together” initiative [136], which was developed through\\nqualitative feedback from dyads and nurses [104]. Pilot data show good feasibility and\\nimprovement in emotional distress and resiliency, with a subsequent single-blind\\nrandomized controlled trial funded by the National Institute of Nursing Research underway.\\nAs critical care physicians, we need to unite our efforts to develop interventions that address\\nthe “critical care experience” and its effect on patients and caregivers regardless of the acute\\ninjury.\\nGiven the interrelation among patient and caregiver factors, the documented chronicity of\\ndepression, anxiety, and PTS, and the interaction between the physical, emotional, and\\ncognitive recovery in PICS and PICS-F, we recommend the development of screening\\nmethods to identify dyads of patients and caregivers who are at risk, and the development of\\npreventive, tailored interventions for these dyads. Both NeuroICU survivors and caregivers\\ndefinitively deserve our attention on long-term recovery and the prospect of a better life.',\n",
       " 'Introduction\\nPatient-centered care (PCC) is essential to improving patient experiences and care quality, as it considers\\nindividual patient preferences, needs, and values. Cultural differences and language barriers in acutely\\nhospitalized patients can result in multiple challenges in patient care and communication, rendering\\npatients and their families more vulnerable at a critical time.

DOI 10.7759/cureus.37687\\nsufficiently address the complex needs of members of immigrant communities [1]. Increasing evidence\\nsuggests that our effectiveness as physicians is related to our ability to understand and connect with our\\npatients, including their language and cultural and religious aspects [2].\\nAt our institution, culturally competent care of our increasingly diverse patient population, responsiveness\\nto patients’ value-based needs, and a patient-centered approach to care are crucial aspects of high-quality\\ncare. The primary mission of Harborview Medical Center is to provide healthcare for the most vulnerable\\nresidents of King County, including immigrant communities and populations with Non-English language\\npreference (NELP) [3]. Our institution utilizes a Caseworker Cultural Mediator (CCM) program to bridge care\\nand communication gaps for these populations [4]. This CCM service serves NELP populations in five\\nlanguages (Amharic, Cambodian/Khmer, Somali, Spanish, and Vietnamese: i.e., CCM consultation eligible\\npatients).\\nIn addition to medical interpretation, CCM provides patient, healthcare provider, and community support.\\nCCM contributes to the well-being and support of immigrant and refugee patients, families, and\\ncommunities through a partnership that promotes culturally sensitive care by 1) providing interpretation\\nservices, 2) forming and maintaining partnerships with patients and their families, and facilitating their\\ninteractions with hospital staff, 3) providing information about cultural norms [5] and perceptions around\\nhealth, illness, and community resources to healthcare providers, 4) advocating for patients and their\\nfamilies and their needs in the healthcare setting, and 5) community outreach to provide healthcare-related\\neducation. CCM services have important goals: a) supporting patients and their families during their\\nhospitalization, b) facilitating therapeutic relationships and trust between patients, families, and the\\nhealthcare team [6]. Their involvement may benefit patients and the healthcare system and may be helpful\\nto hospitals that care for socially and culturally diverse populations [7]. While there is data on the successes\\nof cultural case workers in community outreach programs, specifically in increasing prenatal visits and\\nreduction in HbAIc levels due to educational visits by bicultural/bilingual community health workers [8],\\nthere are no studies examining the involvement of CCMs in neurocritical care (NCC).\\nWhen faced with acute neurological emergencies and life-or-death decisions facing prognostic uncertainty,\\nit is critical to consider cultural norms and perceptions while communicating with patients and families [9].\\nBased on two index cases involving NELP patients’ families and surrogate decision-makers experiencing\\nconflict, leading to emotional distress for both the families and neurocritical care providers, a 3-phase\\nquality improvement (QI) project was implemented in 2020 to 1) identify deficiencies and inconsistencies in\\nend-of-life care and then to 2) develop and implement a consensus-based initiative to incorporate CCM\\ninvolvement on our neurocritical care service. This article describes our experience developing and\\nimplementing the initiative to provide culturally sensitive care and examines the effect of a QI process on\\nCCM involvement. We also aimed to characterize practice patterns and the impact of CCM consultation by\\nassessing characteristics associated with CCM involvement and the impact of CCM involvement.\\nMaterials And Methods\\nInstitutional review board\\nThis study (STUDY00009382) was approved on March 1, 2022, by the Institutional Review Board of the\\nUniversity of Washington, and a waiver of consent was in place for a retrospective analysis of data gathered\\nbetween 1/1/2014 and 1/31/2021.\\nStudy design and patient selection\\nWe assessed the involvement of CCM in primarily Amharic/Cambodian/Khmer/Somali/Spanish/Vietnamese-\\nspeaking adult patients at a 413-bed, level-I trauma and designated Comprehensive Stroke Center with a 30-\\nbed dedicated neurocritical care service. Patients were included and deemed “CCM eligible” if they or their\\nfamilies were identified as members of the respective community. We launched a quality improvement\\nproject in January 2019 to raise awareness and encourage healthcare providers to consider CCM referrals.\\nThe period of 1/1/2014 to 1/31/2018 was considered the pre-CCM project implementation period, and that\\nbetween 1/1/2019 to 1/31/2021 was considered the post-CCM project implementation period. At our\\ninstitution, CCM involvement can occur via 1) a request made by the healthcare team or 2) self-referral from\\nthe CCM team member after identifying the patient\\'s preferred language in the electronic medical records\\n(EMR). For this study, we retrospectively identified all potentially eligible patients by electronic chart review\\nand compared clinical characteristics and outcomes between eligible patients who received CCM\\nconsultation and those who did not. We also compared CCM referral patterns before and after implementing\\nour QI project.\\nOutcomes of interest\\nThe primary outcomes were 1) rates of CCM involvement before and after the implementation of the QI\\nproject, 2) Differences and outcomes between CCM-eligible patients who received CCM consultation versus\\nthose who didn’t, 3) Qualitative analysis of the CCM role, concerns shared by patients/families and support\\noffered by the CCM team, which was gathered from CCM progress notes entered in the EMR and direct\\nfeedback from the CCM team.\\n2023 Lele et al. Cureus 15(4): e37687. DOI 10.7759/cureus.37687\\n2 of 14\\nThe structure and function of the CCM team\\nThe CCM team comprises hospital employees representing five communities of NELP patients and families:\\nAmharic, Cambodian/Khmer, Somali, Spanish, and Vietnamese. Each representative is proficient in the\\nlanguage, has been born in the respective country, and shares the same cultural background. All CCMs\\nreceive advanced training in medical interpretation, cultural mediation, and case management, understand\\nthe role of the community advisor as a resource person, understand the resources and roles of the health\\nand social institutions in the local area, interact with health care professionals, and reviewing cases with\\nmedical staff [10].\\nThe CCM team is typically available for consultation with medical teams between Monday and Friday during\\nthe daytime. While not routinely available on the weekend, exceptions are made for complex cases, and the\\ncritical care team may contact the CCM team. As part of the internal CCM self-referral process, the CCM\\nteam reviews the list of all hospitalized patients daily to identify patients/families/surrogate decision-\\nmakers they may be able to support.\\nFollowing consultation or self-referral, the CCM approaches the patient/families/surrogate decision-maker,\\nprovides education regarding the role of the CCM team, and offers involvement of the CCM team. CCMs are\\nresponsible for documenting patient encounters in the EMR. Once a referral is received, and the family has\\nagreed to CCM involvement, the CCM will meet with the care team and delineate an individualized plan\\nregarding communication and multidisciplinary family meetings. During these meetings, families receive\\neducational material related to critical illnesses or death by neurological criteria (DNC).\\nCommunication with the care team is essential to CCM workflow. CCM add themselves to the patient\\'s care\\nteam list in the EMR and document family meetings and phone calls with patients/families. This establishes\\ncontinuity of care and informs other healthcare team members about their involvement. The workflow of the\\nCCM encompasses the following standards of practice: Navigation, Case Management, Mediation/Advocacy,\\nEducation, and Interpretation. CCM seeks out resources in the patient’s community that provide cultural,\\nreligious, and social support and often partners with religious leaders. In addition to direct patient contact,\\nCCM interacts with outside hospitals, schools, and social organizations and organizes health fairs in their\\ncommunities. Thus, the CCMs offer a wrap-around service by connecting patients and families to internal\\nand external resources.\\nOutline of the QI project\\nFigure 1 describes the three phases of the project.\\nFIGURE 1: Phases and Timeline for the Neurocritical Care Service\\nCaseworker Cultural Mediator (CCM) Involvement Project\\nCCM: Caseworker Cultural Mediator; NCCS: Neurocritical Care Service\\nPhase 0 consisted of a review of two index cases involving two patients belonging to NELP and CCM-eligible\\ncommunities who were declared DNC, resulting in contentious discussions with the care team after the\\nfamily had a difficult time coming to terms with the medical diagnosis. The CCM was involved late in the\\nprocess after communication breakdowns had occurred and provided remediation support to healthcare\\nproviders and families. This was the first time our neurocritical care team recognized the importance of the\\nCCM team’s expertise in supporting NELP patients and mediating conflict.\\nPhase I consisted of several rounds of discussions between the neurocritical care team and members of the\\nCCM team to delineate synergistic interactions between the CCM and the healthcare team. Initially, the\\nauthor AVL met with the CCM team to obtain input regarding the perceptions of CCM-eligible patients\\n2023 Lele et al. Cureus 15(4): e37687. DOI 10.7759/cureus.37687\\n3 of 14\\ntowards end-of-life care and DNC. Several themes emerged, such as insufficient time between admission and\\nneurological prognostication, insufficient time for the family to process the loved one’s condition, and\\nperceived lack of accommodation by the neurocritical care service of the requests by families/surrogate\\ndecision-makers towards the continuation of care/somatic support. At the end of these discussions, a plan\\nwas made to invite CCM team members to a monthly multidisciplinary neurocritical care service meeting to\\nenhance regular dialogue between the CCM and neurocritical care teams.\\nPhase II consisted of educational sessions with the CCM team. The neurocritical care service put together a\\nproposal to incorporate the benefits of the CCM team in routine neurocritical care workflow. It was decided\\nthat prompt consultation with the CCM team would occur within 24 hours of the patient’s admission to the\\nneurocritical care service.\\nWe created flyers that included the project proposal, contact information for the project leads from\\nneurocritical care service and CCM teams, authors AVL and LAM, respectively, and held several educational\\nsessions.\\nSimultaneously at this time, the hospital’s DNC policy underwent a revision. Due to the two index cases, it\\nwas decided to include a multidisciplinary huddle before the initiation of DNC determination with the\\ninvolvement of the CCM team before approaching families/surrogate decision-makers regarding DNC, as\\noutlined in the World Brain Death Project [9].\\nPhase III\\nWe collected data on the involvement of the CCM team, time from admission to the participation of the CCM\\nteam, as well as progress noted by CCM, neurocritical care service, nurses, and social workers.\\nData Collection\\nPatient information and specific data were collected from the EMR and refined via a departmental database,\\nPerioperative & Pain Initiatives in Quality Safety Outcome (PPIQSO). The data points collected were as\\nfollows:\\n1) Patient characteristics: age, sex, admitting diagnosis, race, ethnicity, preferred language, insurance\\ncarrier, admitting Glasgow Coma Scale score (GCS), the maximum (SOFA) scores, need and duration of\\nmechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital length of stay (LOS), all-cause in-hospital\\nmortality, transition to comfort measures only (CMO) and DNC.\\n2) Caseworker cultural mediator (CCM) services: We screened the EMR for the consultation notes by\\nmembers of the CCM team. We noted the date and time the first note was written and calculated the time\\nsince admission to the consultation note (in days).\\n3) Authors AVL and AB met with members of the CCM team over a Zoom TM (San Jose, CA, USA) conference\\ncall to obtain insight from CCM team members about a priori selected topics: 1) common concerns voiced by\\nthe CCM-eligible patients/families/surrogate decision makers, 2) common requests made by CCM-eligible\\npatients/families as relayed by CCM team members, 3) and discussed proposed solutions.\\n4) Author AB extracted clinical notes for all CCM and neurocritical care service encounters for the\\ncorresponding days from the study participants from the electronic medical record and saved them as\\nMicrosoft Word documents.\\n5) We examined the notes for follow-up meetings with patients/families or a lack thereof.\\nStatistical Analysis\\nThe descriptive analysis described the study cohort characteristics. Categorical variables were expressed as\\ncounts and percentages. The Shapiro-Wilk test was performed to examine the normality of distribution of\\ncontinuous variables such as age, intensive care unit, and hospital length of stay expressed as mean+SD or\\nmedian [interquartile range, IQR]. Differences between patient characteristics in the pre-and post-\\nimplementation periods were performed using a two-tailed t-test and Chi-square test and calculated odds\\nratios and 95% confidence interval (CI). We also compared the patients in whom CCM self-referral led to\\nfamilies declining their request to be involved in the patient\\'s care. We used the Chi-square test to\\nunderstand the temporal trends in CCM involvement between 2014 and 2021. In multivariate models, we\\nexamined characteristics of patients who received CCM among CCM-eligible cases, associations between\\nCCM involvement and transition to CMO, and associations between CCM involvement and ICU LOS after\\nadjusting for age, admission GCS, mechanical ventilation, and maximum SOFA scores. We reported the\\nresults as adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and corresponding 95% CIs. Multivariate models were tested for\\nHosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test. A Bonferroni-corrected p-value of < 0.05 was considered to be\\n2023 Lele et al. Cureus 15(4): e37687. DOI 10.7759/cureus.37687\\n4 of 14\\nstatistically significant. Qualitative analysis pertained to the common themes identified after discussion\\nwith CCM team members and after a review of clinical notes. We codified major and minor themes and\\npresented them as counts and percentages.

Our main finding was that implementing\\nthe QI project was independently associated with increasing CCM involvement. Other results include 1) CCM\\ninvolvement preferentially occurred in the NELP patients with higher illness severity, 2) CCMs were more\\nlikely to be involved with NELP patients undergoing a transition to CMO, and those with longer ICU LOS,\\nhowever, when adjusted for illness severity, these associations became non-significant, 3) four out of ten\\nattempts made by CCMs to reach out to the family to provide support were declined by the family, 4) CCMs\\nreported providing cultural/emotional support, end-of-life counseling, conflict mediation, and facilitated\\ngoals of care meetings.\\nA multiphase QI project successfully increased the involvement of CCMs in the care of NELP patients. The\\nindividualized awareness of and attention to the needs of patients provided with the help of cultural\\nmediators is integral to understanding the unique needs of our increasingly diverse populace. Patient\\ndifferences in race/ethnicity can affect patient evaluations of care in many ways, potentially resulting in\\nhealthcare disparities. In a study comparing patient-centered care from the viewpoint of cancer patients of\\ndifferent ethnicities and races, unmet needs for time to make decisions and provider interaction between\\nvisits emerged among Blacks and Caucasian patients. At the same time, value for optimism was observed\\namong Hispanic patients [13]. By creating awareness and bridging gaps in knowledge about the CCM team’s\\n2023 Lele et al. Cureus 15(4): e37687. DOI 10.7759/cureus.37687\\n12 of 14\\nrole on the part of the healthcare team, we attempted to address the lack of guidelines and protocols\\nregarding CCM consultation triggers and successfully reduced the potential for missed opportunities.\\nHowever, more work needs to be done in this area. Given the low rate of CCM involvement and a sizeable\\nNELP population that can potentially benefit, we suggest solutions to increase consistency and\\nsustainability in the participation of the CCM team. These solutions are aimed at overcoming\\ncommunication barriers and bridging cultural gaps. This could be achieved by monthly educational\\nopportunities for neurocritical care healthcare providers, including mandatory virtual/on-demand training,\\nsetting up institutional guidelines, and a consultancy request through the EMR, which was not present at the\\ntime of the study. Finally, adequate hospital resources should be reserved for the growth and sustenance of\\nthe CCM team and for exploring ways to expand services to other NELP communities beyond those currently\\nsupported.\\nOur study finds that CCM involvement was utilized for the sickest NELP patients and end-of-life support,\\nincluding transitions to CMO and patients with longer ICU LOS. Since prognostication after neurological\\nand neurosurgical emergencies often involves complex and time-sensitive conversations with the\\npatients/families/surrogate decision makers, the CCM team may be seen as a “last resort” or after a\\ncommunication breakdown with patient/patient families instead of employing a proactive approach to\\naddress and overcome language, cultural and religious barriers. This argument is highlighted by the two\\nindex cases where the CCM team had to resort to remediation regarding complex medical decision-making.\\nOur study indicated that CCM involvement was not associated with an increased likelihood of CMO\\ntransitions and non-CMO in-hospital mortality when adjusted for illness severity. The project also\\nhighlights that within the construct of CMO discussions, without influencing the outcome (CMO or ICU\\nLOS), the involvement of the CCM team may provide opportunities to provide culturally sensitive care to\\nNCC patients in a time-sensitive manner.\\nThe majority of CCM involvements included a proactive approach by the CCM team to identify patients\\nbased on their preferred language listed in EMR. The CCM team members introduced themselves to the\\npatients/families, educated them on the support that could be provided, and left their contact information.\\nIn a minority of cases, we found that the social worker/bedside nurse/case manager/primary critical care\\nteam members reached out to CCM. The few times the critical care team reached out to CCM were in the\\ncontext of end-of-life support and DNC. One case of DNC highlighted challenges in the accommodation of\\nfamily requests after the diagnosis of the DNC was completed by the neurocritical care service. It underlined\\nthe importance of a proactive multidisciplinary approach to culturally sensitive care, as highlighted and\\nrecommended in the World Brain Death Project [9].\\nMedical care for NELP patients and families is stressful in various aspects, only one of which is the barrier of\\nlanguage [14]. CCMs likely contribute to their sense of control and support and provide solutions to real\\nproblems such as finance and housing. We were surprised to find that 4 out of 10 self-referrals by the CCMs\\nresulted in a lack of a request by the NELP families to seek the support of CCM. The exact reasons for this are\\nunknown, but our study suggests that in patients with high illness severity, families may reach out to CCMs\\nfor support when faced with challenges related to end-of-life/goals of care conversations. Future studies may\\nexamine why NELP families may not seek CCM support in neurocritical care.\\nLimitations\\nSeveral limitations are apparent, mainly because this was a single-center, nonrandomized quality\\nimprovement project with before/after comparison. Most importantly, this project did not examine\\npatient/family-centered outcomes; thus, it was impossible to compare perceptions of the family/surrogate\\ndecision-makers towards culturally sensitive care provided with and without the involvement of CCMs. This\\nlow rate may be multifactorial such as lack of awareness and participation of CCMs only if there is a conflict\\nbetween the neurocritical care provider and the families/surrogate decision makers. Another limitation of\\nthe current system at HMC for CCMs to know about potential patients/family needing their services\\n(proactive approach) is that the CCMs only know of patients needing their services based on the patient\\'s\\nlanguage as listed in the EMR, which may not always be recorded accurately. It does not factor in their\\nfamilies’ preferred language. Unless CCMs get a referral from a critical care team member, the CCM team\\nmay be unable to identify these families prospectively. Hence, the results from our study may not be\\ngeneralizable to adult NCC patients outside our hospital but provide a benchmark for other hospitals and\\nneurocritical care units/services to compare against.\\nConclusions\\nA local QI project rollout increased the involvement of CCMs in neurocritical care. This project attempts to\\ncreate awareness among neurocritical care healthcare providers on ways to support NELP patients and\\nfamilies of different cultural backgrounds. The study results are encouraging, and there is potential to spread\\nthis awareness to other NELP patients/families and contexts other than critical care environments. The\\nlessons learned from this study informed the neurocritical care and CCM team members that 1) NELP\\npatients/families need support in many areas, support that typically is not provided by a medical interpreter,\\n2) there may be patients/families that may decline to follow up with a CCM team member, 3) high illness\\nseverity, end-of-life and goals of care conversations may be seen as triggers for CCM support, and 4) If CCM\\n2023 Lele et al.

The perceptions of NELP patients/families regarding routine\\ninvolvement of CCM in neurocritical care and its impact deserve further examination.\\nAdditional Information\\nDisclosures\\nHuman subjects: Consent was obtained or waived by all participants in this study.

The COVID-19 pandemic has\\nfurther intensified this experience in addition to exacerbating clinician and resident burnout. To ameliorate some of these\\nconcerns, a team of resident and medical student trainees implemented a virtual shared medical appointment (vSMA)\\nprogram for inpatients with acute cerebrovascular disorders and their caregivers. The authors hypothesized that an early\\nintervention in the form of a vSMA improves patient and caregiver health literacy and preparedness while simultaneously\\neducating clinical trainees on effective communication skills and reducing clinician burnout.\\nMETHODS\\u2002 Patients and caregivers of admitted patients were identified through a census of neurosurgery, neurocritical\\ncare, and neurology electronic medical records. A weekly 60-minute secure virtual session consisted of introductions\\nand a 10-minute standardized presentation on cerebrovascular disease management, followed by participant-guided\\ndiscussion. Participants completed presession and postsession surveys. Through this small feasibility study data were\\nobtained regarding present challenges, both expected and unforeseen.\\nRESULTS\\u2002 A total of 170 patients were screened, and 13 patients and 26 caregivers participated in at least 1 vSMA\\nsession. A total of 6 different healthcare providers facilitated sessions. The vSMA program received overwhelmingly\\npositive feedback from caregivers. Survey responses demonstrated that 96.4% of caregivers and 75% of patients were\\nsatisfied with the session, 96.4% of caregivers and 87.5% of patients would recommend this type of appointment to a\\nfriend or family member, and 88.8% of providers reported feeling validated by conducting the session. The participant\\ngroup had a 20% greater percentage of patients discharged home without home needs compared to the nonparticipant\\ngroup. The primary obstacles encountered included technological frustrations with the consent process and the sessions\\nthemselves.\\nCONCLUSIONS\\u2002 Implementation of a vSMA program at a tertiary care center during a pandemic was feasible. Themes\\ncaregivers expressed on the postsession survey included better understanding of caring for a stroke patient and coping\\nwith the unpredictability of a patient’s prognosis. The pandemic has precipitated shifts toward telehealth, but this study\\nhighlights the importance of avoiding marginalization of elderly and less technologically inclined populations.\\nhttps://thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/2022.4.FOCUS21764\\nKEYWORDS\\u2002 shared medical appointment; telehealth; stroke; health literacy; resident burnout; patient-provider\\nrelationship\\nNeurosurg Focus\\u2002 Volume 52 • June 2022\\n1\\n©AANS 2022, except where prohibited by US copyright law\\nUnauthenticated | Downloaded 01/17/26 10:55 PM UTC\\nMahajan et al.\\nNeurosurg Focus\\u2002 Volume 52 • June 2022\\n2\\nS\\nhared medical appointments (SMAs) are an evi-\\ndenced-based practice defined as group-based clin-\\nical appointments that bring together patients with\\nsimilar medical conditions.1 The sessions are typically me-\\ndiated by healthcare providers and integrate clinical, psycho-\\nlogical, and socioeconomic aspects of disease management.\\nSMAs have been found to have positive effects on quality\\nmeasures. They have been reported to enhance the patient-\\nclinician relationship and improve patient perceptions of\\nproviders and health systems.2 By sharing experiences and\\nlearning from peers, patients report an improved capacity\\nfor self-advocacy. From a provider perspective, SMAs in-\\ncrease efficiency, reduce redundancy, and educate providers\\non what patients care about.3 The use of a group dynamic\\nalters the traditional power structure between clinician and\\npatient, with the belief that patients will feel more empow-\\nered to verbalize questions, issues, and success stories.4\\nFor patients with cerebrovascular diseases, a diagnosis\\nis often made in the acute inpatient setting after an ische-\\nmic or hemorrhagic event.5 For this reason, we sought to\\nconduct a pilot SMA for patients with cerebrovascular dis-\\nease in an inpatient setting. Given the neurological sequel-\\nae often associated with this disease, in this pilot study\\nwe also sought to engage caregivers early in the course of\\ntreatment. The study, initially designed to be performed\\nwith in-person SMAs, coincided with the COVID pan-\\ndemic and the meetings were ultimately transformed into\\nvirtual SMAs (vSMAs).\\nThe objective of this pilot was to develop a care path-\\nway to improve patient and caregiver health literacy, self-\\nefficacy, and satisfaction. We hoped that a vSMA con-\\nducted as an early intervention would help patients and\\ncaregivers learn to understand and manage their disease\\nprocess and feel more comfortable navigating a complex\\nhealthcare system. Secondary objectives were to reduce\\nhealthcare provider burnout through a more humanistic\\napproach to patient care.\\nMethods\\nThis study received grant funding from the American\\nCollege for Graduate Medical Education. Institutional re-\\nview board approval was obtained from University Hospi-\\ntals Cleveland Medical Center.\\nFor study enrollment, patients with an admission lon-\\nger than 24 hours as well as caregivers of admitted pa-\\ntients were screened through the neurosurgery, neurocriti-\\ncal care, and neurology electronic medical record census.\\nPaid medical student research assistants performed the\\ncensus of patient data and contacted families for enroll-\\nment. Inclusion criteria are shown in Table 1. All patients\\nunderwent a capacity assessment prior to enrollment. A\\npatient’s declination to participate or failure of capacity\\nassessment did not preclude caregiver participation. Par-\\nticipants received $60 in gift cards for their participation\\nin the study ($10 before survey completion and $50 af-\\nter completion of both the vSMA session and postsession\\nsurvey). Repeat participants were permitted. Facilitators\\nwere volunteers who were selected prior to the session and\\nincluded neurosurgical and neurology trainees (residents\\nand fellows), advanced practice providers, and nurses.\\nThe vSMA meetings were structured as follows.\\nWeekly 60-minute secure virtual Zoom (2021 Zoom\\nVideo Communications, Inc.) sessions were conducted\\nfor 10 weeks. The session consisted of introductions and\\na 10-minute standardized presentation on cerebrovascular\\ndisease management, followed by participant-guided dis-\\ncussion. The facilitator was provided with a fidelity check-\\nlist containing leading questions to stimulate conversation.\\nSafety checklists were completed, which included items\\nfor monitoring disputes between participants, neurological\\nor mental status changes in patients, or any safety con-\\ncerns during the session. Facilitators received $75 in gift\\ncards upon completion of all surveys and facilitation tasks.\\nParticipant Outcomes\\nParticipants completed surveys before and after\\nvSMAs. The postsession survey included Likert scale\\nquestionnaires regarding satisfaction with the session,\\neducational value of the session, and recommendations of\\nthe session to family and friends. Patients also answered\\nquestions regarding their level of health literacy. Caregiv-\\ners completed questions on their level of preparedness for\\ncaregiving.

More caregivers than pa-\\ntients were enrolled. Four participating families had more\\nthan 1 caregiver participant. One patient participated 3\\ntimes. Baseline demographic and clinical outcome data\\nof participants, participants with a caregiver, and nonpar-\\nticipants are presented in Table 3. The participant group\\nhad a 20% greater percentage of patients discharged home\\nwithout home needs than the other two groups.\\nPatients and caregivers completed pre- and postsession\\nsurveys, which allowed the study team to qualitatively\\nidentify baseline concerns and benefits gained from the\\nsession. Major concerns voiced in the presession survey\\namong caregivers were a desire to understand the com-\\nplete treatment plan, mental health needs of the patient,\\nand what to expect with the recovery process. Survey out-\\ncomes are presented in Table 4. Among caregivers, 96.4%\\nreported being satisfied with the session and would recom-\\nmend this type of appointment to a friend or family mem-\\nber. Among patients, 75% reported being satisfied with the\\neducational session and felt the session provided informa-\\ntion that they needed to manage their condition at home,\\nwas effective at teaching or reinforcing information they\\nalready knew, covered all the information they needed,\\nand answered their questions, and 87.5% of patients would\\nrecommend this type of appointment to a friend or family\\nmember. Among providers, 100% reported that conduct-\\ning the session improved the medical care of patients and\\nwas not a waste of their time or patients’ time, and 88.5%\\nof providers felt that conducting the session made them\\nfeel validated. With regard to outcomes measured in pre-\\nand postsession surveys, small increases were seen in the\\nhealth literacy of patients (16.3 ± 2.7 vs 17.1 ± 2.1), care-\\ngiver preparedness (26.6 ± 6.7 vs 26.7 ± 5.8), and provider\\nburnout (29.8 ± 3.2 vs 30.2 ± 2.6).\\nIn the postsession survey, caregivers were most con-\\ncerned with the transition from hospital to home, care-\\ngiver well-being, financial stressors, and the coordina-\\ntion of follow-up care. Participants reported feeling more\\neducated after a vSMA in terms of acquiring the tools to\\ntend to the needs of the patient. Free-text responses that\\ncaregivers wrote on their pre- and postsession surveys are\\nincluded in Table 5.\\nDiscussion\\nWe report the qualitative results, thematic content\\nanalysis, and lessons learned from a 10-week vSMA pilot\\nstudy targeting patients with cerebrovascular disorders,\\ntheir caregivers, and the clinician trainees treating this\\npatient population. Although not powered for statistical\\nsignificance, the pilot program received positive feedback\\nfrom participants. The pilot study served to underscore\\nimportant thematic challenges relevant to providing care\\nfor neurologically ill patients in a healthcare system that\\nis increasingly prioritizing telemedicine. Here, we outline\\nthe major challenges we faced and future directions for\\nthis undertaking.\\nImplementation of a vSMA program at a tertiary care\\ncenter during a pandemic was feasible. Our limited survey\\ndata demonstrated that participation in vSMA sessions\\nmay increase health literacy in patients and preparedness\\nin caregivers and reduce burnout in providers. Given that\\nmost participants attended 1–2 sessions, we did not ex-\\npect to see large or significant differences in survey data.\\nWe did observe very positive results via survey questions.\\nMost caregivers and patients were satisfied with the vSMA\\nsessions and would recommend this type of virtual ap-\\npointment to a friend or family member. All providers felt\\nthat this program improved the care of patients and was\\na meaningful use of their time for both themselves and\\ntheir patients, and the majority of providers felt validated\\nby conducting the session. We also observed that patients\\nwho participated or had a family member participating\\nhad a 20% higher rate of discharge to home than patients\\nTABLE 2.

Of note, most of the participants were enrolled prior\\nto discharge. However, this characteristic may have been\\ndue to participant bias such that higher-functioning pa-\\ntients were more able to participate. Additionally, patients\\nwho were going home may have been more motivated to\\nparticipate themselves or more likely to have family par-\\nticipation in our sessions in order to be better prepared and\\nmore informed on care needs at home, which we found\\nwas a common discussion theme. The home discharge rate\\nof participants with caregiver participation was nearly the\\nsame as the rate for those who did not participate. The\\ncaregiver participation group did not include the patients\\nwho chose to participate themselves without a caregiver,\\nand thus may have been skewed in terms of baseline pa-\\ntient functioning.\\nA search through the written responses in the pre- and\\npostsession surveys revealed the major concerns expressed\\nby patients and caregivers. Recurring topics included\\nseeking a better understanding of the treatment plan, man-\\naging mental well-being for both patients and caregivers,\\nhow to motivate a patient, the recovery and rehabilitation\\nprocess, and managing frustrations and expectations of\\nfriends and family. Indeed, poststroke depression occurs\\nin a significant number of patients and leads to greater dis-\\nability.8 Themes caregivers expressed on the postsession\\nsurvey included better understanding of caring for a stroke\\npatient and coping with the unpredictability of a patient’s\\nprognosis. It appears that the sessions may have tempered\\nexpectations for many caregivers regarding rapid recov-\\nery of loved ones. Thematic topics observed during the\\nsessions themselves seemed to be centered around patient\\nmood and communication. Families shared solutions for\\nhow to improve communication with loved ones, includ-\\ning using pictural cards, and facilitators directed families\\nto online resources available from stroke and dementia as-\\nsociations.\\nEnrollment and Pandemic Timing\\nThe launch of this study, which was originally planned\\nfor face-to-face meetings, coincided with the beginning of\\nthe COVID-19 pandemic. Daily modifications in visitor\\nstatus and resident schedules, coupled with the increased\\ndependence on recruitment by phone over face-to-face\\nencounters, posed challenges to recruitment efforts. Dur-\\ning the no-visitor policy, enrollment was enhanced by the\\nlimited contact of caregivers with hospital staff and their\\nloved ones. People had begun to work from home, caregiv-\\ners had more schedule flexibility, and importantly, fami-\\nlies were desperate for any information on hospitalized\\nfamily members, including possibly seeing their loved\\nones virtually. Interest waned with the introduction of a\\nsingle-visitor policy.\\nInterpersonal Connection\\nVirtual sessions can alter the safety and security felt\\nduring a group session. With the virtual platform, con-\\ncerns exist about health information security breaches,\\nwhich along with outside distractions can prevent partici-\\npants from fully interacting during sessions.9,10 Empathy\\nand understanding can be difficult to convey in a virtual\\nplatform.11 Nonetheless, past studies have shown that vir-\\ntual sessions decrease disease-related stressors, possibly\\nthrough increasing accessibility to health information.12,13\\nWe were able to observe very tangible emotions, frustra-\\ntions, and empathy shared between struggling families.\\nAccess and Marginalization\\nThe use of virtual technology served to increase ac-\\ncess for many individuals. However, an unintended conse-\\nquence was the marginalization of populations who lacked\\naccess to smart technology. Digital divides are known to\\nexist within socioeconomic strata and generational age\\ngroups.14,15 Solutions we implemented to improve access\\nincluded creating continuity through the use of a recurring\\nZoom link for every week, the development and distribu-\\ntion of a picture-based navigational manual depicting how\\nto log in from the emailed link, and physically setting up\\nthe session for participants in the hospital. Despite these\\nmultipronged efforts, technology posed a major hindrance\\nin study participation. Persisting roadblocks included par-\\nticipants who were unable to log in, sit in front of their\\nscreens, or correctly use cameras; confusion over use of\\nTABLE 5.

Many screened caregivers did not have telephone\\naccess, used only analog or flip phones, or had work obli-\\ngations. Previous studies have shown that caregivers with\\ngreater financial pressure face greater stress, particularly\\nwhen caring for disabled patients with stroke.16 Thus, it\\nis imperative to find innovative ways of outreach to assist\\nthese populations who continue to face barriers to tele-\\nmedicine care.\\nChallenges With Scheduling\\nIt was challenging for younger caregivers to attend ses-\\nsions held during working hours, whereas evening hours\\nwere challenging for patients and older individuals. One\\nobjective of the study was to reduce clinical burnout\\nthrough building relationships with patients and caregiv-\\ners. Clinical obligations impeded the recruitment of a\\nlarger number of resident surgical trainees as facilitators.\\nResidents who did participate found benefit and enjoyed\\nfacilitating the sessions, but for many other residents it\\nwas not a high priority despite monetary incentives. While\\ncertain studies have demonstrated that utilization of tele-\\nmedicine or SMAs can lead to decreased burnout,17,18 par-\\nticipation in this study did not necessarily reduce work-\\nload or increase efficiency for clinicians. Integration of the\\ninformation provided by this pilot study into permanent\\nmetrics such as billing advantages, reduction in time spent\\nin individual family conversations, and increased patient\\nand family satisfaction may better incentivize trainees or\\nfaculty. Outpatient SMAs are most often run by advanced\\npractice practitioners for cost purposes and such a pro-\\ngram, whether inpatient or outpatient, might benefit from\\na more stable and available facilitating team.\\nManaging Expectations\\nFor this pilot initiative, the medical students who per-\\nformed the census of patient data and contacted families\\nfor enrollment were paid research assistants. However, al-\\nthough the task was expected to be brief, it became oner-\\nous as a significant amount of time was spent explaining\\nthe study objectives and conducting multiple callbacks.\\nDespite these efforts, many patients and their families\\nwere absent even though they completed enrollment. Sev-\\neral caregivers presumed the session would consist of a\\npersonal meeting with the physician conducted at the pa-\\ntient bedside. Increased clarity and a more streamlined\\nprocess could ensure sustainability and increase satisfac-\\ntion of clinicians as well as caregivers and patients.\\nOther Considerations\\nGiven the brevity of the pilot study, participants gener-\\nally attended 1–2 sessions. The intention was to include\\nparticipants in different phases of their medical journey,\\nfrom critical care unit to hospital floor, through discharge\\nto rehabilitation, and in the months recovering at home. By\\ncreating a temporal layering effect with participants shar-\\ning experiences at different stages, we hoped to increase\\nengagement, learning, and preparedness.4 When this did\\noccur, participants reported finding the sessions to be in-\\ncredibly informative. Finally, in the future, given the vir-\\ntual nature of the program, incorporating stroke patients\\nat satellite or community hospitals may allow for an even\\ngreater reach and volume of participants.19\\nConclusions\\nWith the more than 10-fold increase in virtual visits\\ndue to their increasing importance during the COVID-19\\npandemic and subsequent continued use as an adjunct to\\non-site clinical contact, implementing effective vSMA\\nvisits will be of greater importance in the future.20 Al-\\nthough our data showed limited outcome improvements,\\ngiven the pilot nature of this study the results provide a\\nsense of optimism. Despite the identified implementation\\nchallenges, the pilot program garnered positive feedback.\\nFuture efforts to increase access for marginalized popula-\\ntions and identify optimal metrics to assess quality and\\nclinical outcomes are important to exploring the potential\\nbenefits of vSMAs in serving the needs of patients with\\nacute illnesses that have chronic effects.\\nAcknowledgments\\nThis project was funded by a $10,000 Back to Bedside grant\\nfrom the American College for Graduate Medical Education\\n(principal investigator, C.H.W.).

       " 'Introduction\\nTraumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major health concern due to its poor clinical and functional outcome and its\\nimpact on family homeostasis. Often, the stressed and anxious family is not involved in the care process\\nuntil the rehabilitation phase. This study aimed to evaluate the integration of family involvement in the\\nneuro-intensive care of TBI patients on family satisfaction.\\nMaterials and methods\\nThis pre-test-post-test quasi-experimental study involved 70 families of moderate and severe TBI patients,\\ndivided equally into experimental and control groups. A guideline, Family Involvement in the Care of TBI\\n(FIC-TBI), was developed. The key elements of this guideline were structured communication, participation\\nin basic care, and shared decision-making. FIC-TBI was integrated into the critical care management of TBI.\\nThe impact of FIC-TBI was evaluated using the Family Satisfaction in the ICU Care Unit 24R (FS-ICU 24R)\\ntool.\\nResults\\nData analysis was done through paired and unpaired t-tests as well as analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). The\\nresults showed statistically significant differences in the post-test family satisfaction scores between the\\nexperimental and control groups. The adjusted mean satisfaction scores of components such as satisfaction\\nwith care (F(1, N-2)=984.63; p<0.001), satisfaction with decision-making (F(1, N-2)=1489.63; p<0.001), and\\noverall satisfaction (F(1, N-2)=712.87; p<0.001) were higher in the experimental group. The study found a\\nsignificant correlation between family satisfaction levels and variables such as gender and education.\\nConclusions\\nThis study was done with the objective to evaluate the impact of integration of family involvement into the\\nneuro-intensive care of TBI on family satisfaction. The findings demonstrated that the FIC-TBI guideline\\nimproved satisfaction across multiple dimensions, such as care, communication, decision-making, and\\noverall experience. The study also found a significant correlation between family satisfaction and gender\\nand education. This study emphasized the importance of early family involvement in critical care settings as\\na vital component of holistic TBI management.\\nCategories: Family/General Practice, Neurosurgery, Trauma\\nKeywords: communication, family icu syndrome, family involvement in care, family satisfaction, family satisfaction\\nin the intensive care unit 24r (fs-icu 24r), holistic neurocritical care model, neuro-intensive care, shared decision-\\nmaking in the icu, staff burnout, traumatic brain injury critical care\\nIntroduction\\nTraumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant and persistent challenge within healthcare systems worldwide.\\nThis heightened concern stems from several critical factors, including its high mortality and morbidity rates,\\nthe disproportionate impact on young adults, poor clinical and functional recovery outcomes, and the\\nprofound disruption it causes to family life and quality of living [1].

Factors such as limited visitation opportunities,\\nfear of losing their loved one, and the overwhelming stress of the situation significantly contribute to their\\nemotional distress [4,5]. These challenges frequently result in heightened interactions between families and\\nneuro-ICU staff. However, communication in these scenarios is often brief, focused primarily on clinical\\nfacts, and leaves little opportunity for families to express their emotions or seek psychological support from\\nthe staff [6-10].\\nWhile TBI treatment has traditionally prioritized clinical recovery, growing evidence emphasizes the\\nimportance of addressing the psychological and emotional well-being of both patients and their families as\\nintegral to successful outcomes [11,12]. Families increasingly desire greater involvement in the care process,\\nand their interactions with healthcare providers play a pivotal role in shaping treatment experiences and\\noutcomes [13-15]. Research indicates that when families are actively involved in essential care within the\\nneuro-ICU, both patient recovery and family satisfaction improve significantly [16,17].\\nThe introduction of protocols that emphasize effective communication, structured family involvement, and\\nshared decision-making is essential for creating a supportive care environment. Such protocols not only\\nuphold the rights of patients but also alleviate the psychological burden on families, fostering trust and\\nsatisfaction in the care process [18,19]. Family involvement extends beyond providing emotional support. It\\nincludes participation in basic patient care, engaging in care planning discussions, and assisting the\\nhealthcare team in tailoring interventions based on the patient\\'s preferences. This collaboration not only\\nempowers families to cope with stress but also helps multidisciplinary teams deliver more patient-centered\\ncare [20,21]. Studies have shown that involving families in communication and care planning significantly\\nreduces their levels of anxiety and depression while enhancing their overall experience in the ICU [22,23].\\nAdditionally, family involvement ensures continuity of care, which is particularly vital for TBI patients,\\nmany of whom face prolonged physical and cognitive rehabilitation challenges [24,25].\\nIn recent years, family satisfaction has emerged as a critical measure of quality in critical care settings.\\nResearch consistently demonstrates that improved communication, shared decision-making, and active\\nfamily participation are associated with higher levels of satisfaction. A meta-analysis of family-centered care\\nmodels revealed notable reductions in stress levels and enhanced satisfaction among families involved in the\\ncare process [26-28].\\nThis study explores the impact of structured family involvement in the care of TBI patients on family\\nsatisfaction. It forms part of a larger initiative aimed at developing and evaluating the Neuro Intensive Care\\nProtocol for TBI (NICP-TBI). A key component of this protocol is the Family Involvement in the Care of TBI\\n(FIC-TBI), which provides clear guidelines for structured communication, participation in basic care, and\\nshared decision-making [29,30]. By integrating family involvement into TBI management, this study seeks to\\nadvance understanding and improve outcomes in neurocritical care settings.\\nMaterials And Methods\\nThis prospective pre-test-post-test quasi-experimental study was done in the neuro-ICUs of Tellicherry Co-\\noperative Hospital and Indira Gandhi Co-operative Hospital Thalassery between June 2022 and May 2024.\\nThe purpose of the study was to evaluate the impact of the integration of family involvement in the care of\\nTBI patients on family satisfaction. The study involved 70 families of TBI patients, equally distributed to\\nexperimental and control groups. This study was part of a broader study titled \"Development, validation,\\nand evaluation of a neuro intensive care protocol for TBI (NICP -TBI)\". FIC-TBI was one of the components\\nof the NICP-TBI. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee (IEC) of Sri\\nRamachandra Institute of Higher Education and Research (approval number: IEC/21/OCT/165/69). All\\nsamples were given participant information sheets and informed consent.\\nSelection of sample\\nFamily members of adult patients with moderate (Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score 9-12) or severe (GCS\\nscore ≤8) TBI undergoing treatment in the neuro-ICU for more than 48 hours were considered eligible\\nsamples. Convenience sampling was adopted as the sampling technique.\\nDescription of intervention\\nFIC-TBI Guideline\\nThe broader components of the guideline were structured communication, participation in basic care, and\\nshared decision-making.

Family satisfaction was initially assessed 24 hours post-admission using the\\nFamily Satisfaction in the ICU Care Unit 24R (FS-ICU 24R) scale. Routine care practices and family\\ncommunication processes were maintained throughout the neuro-ICU stay, with a second assessment\\nconducted upon patient transfer from the neuro-ICU.\\nFor the experimental group, a structured guideline titled \"Family Involvement in the Care of TBI (FIC-TBI)\"\\nwas introduced to the neuro-ICU\\'s multidisciplinary healthcare team before study initiation. This\\nintervention was launched through a workshop, where neuro-ICU professionals practiced the care model\\nwith standardized patient and family scenarios and were evaluated using a scoring sheet. An initial\\nsatisfaction assessment was performed 24 hours after neuro-ICU admission. Subsequently, the FIC-TBI\\nguideline was systematically integrated into TBI management. A final satisfaction assessment using FS-ICU\\n24R was conducted after each patient\\'s neuro-ICU stay.\\nResults\\nDescription of sample characteristics in the experimental and control\\ngroups\\nThe study included a total of 70 participants, equally distributed between the experimental group (n=35) and\\nthe control group (n=35). A comparative analysis of the baseline characteristics revealed that both groups\\nwere generally comparable across most demographic variables, such as gender, age distribution, relationship\\nwith the patient, and previous ICU experience. However, a statistically significant difference was observed\\nin the educational status of participants between the two groups (p=0.03). This indicates that the two groups\\nwere otherwise homogenous, with education being the only exception. The detailed breakdown of the\\ncharacteristics is presented in Table 2.\\n2024 Mathew et al.

This finding is consistent with a study by Davidson et al.,\\nwhich emphasized how family-centered approaches addressed the psychological needs of families, reducing\\ntheir anxiety and promoting a more inclusive environment [15]. Similarly, Coombs et al. found that effective\\ncommunication fosters a sense of partnership between family members and healthcare providers, thereby\\nincreasing satisfaction [13].\\n2024 Mathew et al.

DOI 10.7759/cureus.74748\\n6 of 9\\nIn terms of decision-making satisfaction, our study findings align closely with the findings of a study by\\nCurtis and White, which documented that involving family members in decision-making processes leads to\\ngreater clarity and satisfaction with care outcomes [27]. Olding et al. also highlighted the importance of\\nfamily engagement in critical decisions, which is associated with improved family understanding and\\ncomfort in a critical care setting [14].\\nThe correlation analysis in this study indicated that family satisfaction is significantly associated with\\ndemographic factors such as gender and education. This analysis indicates the importance of considering\\ndemographic factors in understanding and improving satisfaction with critical care. Mitchell and Aitken\\'s\\nresearch similarly found that demographic characteristics influence family needs and their perception of ICU\\ncare quality, and the study suggested the necessity of a structured approach to meet diverse family\\nexpectations [23]. Adams et al. echoed these findings, noting that understanding family characteristics can\\nenhance satisfaction by facilitating customized support [24].\\nStudy limitations\\nThis study has certain limitations that could affect the generalizability of the results. The relatively small\\nsample size (n=70) may limit the statistical power when applied to broader populations or different neuro-\\nICU settings. The use of self-reported measures through the FS-ICU 24R tool could introduce bias, as\\nparticipants may feel inclined to respond positively due to perceived social expectations. To validate the\\nstatistically significant results of FIC-TBI guidelines, multicenter studies across diverse settings are needed.\\nConclusions\\nIn this study, we investigated the impact of the integration of structured family involvement in the care of\\nTBI patients in the neuro-ICU and its correlation with family satisfaction. A total of 70 families of TBI\\npatients were surveyed to evaluate the effects of this approach. This study demonstrated that integrating\\nstructured family involvement using the FIC-TBI guidelines significantly enhances family satisfaction in\\nneuro-ICU settings. This study\\'s findings indicated that structured communication, participation in care,\\nand shared decision-making are the key elements in improving family satisfaction across various\\ndimensions, including care quality and decision-making processes. The correlation with demographic factors\\nlike gender and education, found in the study, highlights the need for incorporating a holistic approach and\\npersonalized family support strategies in neurocritical care. Future research should expand on the findings\\nwith larger, multicenter studies to further validate the impact on long-term patient outcomes and adapt the\\nguidelines to diverse cultural settings.\\nAdditional Information\\nAuthor Contributions\\nAll authors have reviewed the final version to be published and agreed to be accountable for all aspects of the\\nwork.\\nConcept and design: Sindu K.

       " 'Introduction\\nAdmission to the neurological intensive care unit (Neuro-ICU) is often characterized by\\nperiods of uncertainty about survival and long-term prognosis, which is stressful for patients\\nand their family caregivers (i.e., family or friends who provide the bulk of unpaid care).\\nUnsurprisingly, rates of clinically significant anxiety symptoms are high among neurocritical\\ncare patients (20–43%) [1–3] and their caregivers (18–46%) [3–5]. Prospective studies\\nof survivors of critical illness have demonstrated that anxiety rates remain elevated well\\nbeyond hospital admission [6, 7]. This is particularly concerning given that anxiety has been\\nassociated with greater risk of major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events and\\nmortality in critically ill patients [8, 9]. In caregivers, chronic anxiety has been associated\\nwith caregiver strain and depression [4].\\nResiliency, a multidimensional biopsychosocial construct defined as the ability to\\nsuccessfully adapt and recover from adversity or trauma [10], has been consistently linked\\nto a variety of positive health outcomes [11–13]. Mindfulness and coping strategies are\\nMeyers et al.\\nPage 2\\nNeurocrit Care. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2025 May 06.\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\ntwo modifiable resilience factors. Mindfulness, or nonjudgmental awareness and focus\\non the present in the face of adversity [14], has been inversely associated with anxiety\\nsymptoms in a cross-sectional dyadic study of neurocritical care patients and their family\\ncaregivers during hospitalization [3, 13]. Mindfulness-based interventions have effectively\\nimproved stress, psychological symptoms, and quality of life for caregivers of patients with\\nneurodegenerative disease [15, 16]. Coping strategies, defined as the cognitive, behavioral,\\nand emotional skills that individuals draw on during times of stress, are also linked to\\npositive psychological and physical health outcomes [17]. In medical populations, adults\\nwith chronic myofascial pain who rely on adaptive coping strategies such as emotion-\\ncentered coping have been found to experience less affective pain and depressive symptoms\\n[18]. Couples undergoing unsuccessful treatment for infertility who use emotion-centered\\ncoping strategies have been shown to suffer less psychological distress in both individuals\\n[18]. In Neuro-ICU patients and caregivers, poor coping strategies have been associated with\\nincreased global emotional distress and elevated psychiatric symptoms [13].\\nAn increasing body of the literature acknowledges that patient and caregiver resiliency\\nfactors and symptoms are interdependent, with each individual’s adjustment to medical\\nillness impacting their partners’ adjustment [19–21]. For example, in a cross-sectional\\nstudy of Neuro-ICU patients and caregivers, depression symptoms have been shown to be\\ninterdependent between patients and caregivers, and high mindfulness in either the patient\\nor caregiver has been associated with lower depression symptoms in both self and partner\\n[3]. Accordingly, current guidelines recommend assessing patient and caregiver factors at\\nthe dyadic level (i.e., patient and caregiver together) [22, 23]. However, the longer-term\\ntrajectory of anxiety symptoms in Neuro-ICU survivors and their family caregivers, the\\nimpact of psychological resilience on that trajectory, and the nuanced role of the dyad in the\\ndevelopment of chronic anxiety symptoms remain unclear.\\nThe current study seeks to fill this gap by first examining the longitudinal trajectory of\\nanxiety symptoms in neurocritical care patients and their caregivers and then exploring\\nprospectively the synergistic relationship between resiliency factors and anxiety in patient–\\ncaregiver dyads. We hypothesize that for both patient and caregiver, anxiety symptoms will\\nbe predictive of one’s own level of anxiety at the subsequent assessment, and that resiliency\\nfactors will be negatively associated with one’s own anxiety symptoms across all time\\npoints. Further, we hypothesize that for both patients and caregivers, anxiety symptoms and\\nresiliency factors will be interdependent, with one’s own anxiety symptoms predicting a\\nhigher level of symptoms in their partner and one’s own resilience being associated with\\nlower levels of anxiety symptoms in their partner at follow-up.\\nMaterials and Methods\\nSample and Design\\nThis is a prospective, longitudinal cohort study of adults admitted to the Neuro-ICU and\\ntheir family caregivers at a large tertiary medical center in Boston, MA, between 2015\\nand 2016. The study was approved by the local institutional review board, and informed\\nconsent was obtained from all participants enrolled in the study. The full recruitment and\\nenrollment protocol has been previously described [3]. The inclusion criteria for patients\\nMeyers et al.\\nPage 3\\nNeurocrit Care. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2025 May 06.\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nwere as follows: (1) adults aged 18 years or older, (2) English fluency and literacy,\\nand (3) hospitalization to the Neuro-ICU within the past 2 weeks. Most patients were\\nenrolled within 2 days of Neuro-ICU admission. Patients were excluded if they were\\ndeemed unable to provide consent due to cognitive impairment; had severe aphasia or\\ncognitive impairment that prohibited full participation; had anticipated death; or did not\\nhave an family caregiver. Patients with cognitive impairments but who were still able to\\nfill out questionnaires with assistance were included. Patients with transient aphasia or\\ndelirium who were asymptomatic at the time of consent were considered medically able to\\nparticipate. Based on historic records from our Neuro-ICU, 70% of all admitted patients\\nwould be eligible for participation. All eligible patients were cleared for participation by the\\nICU team.\\nFamily caregivers were eligible to participate if they met the following criteria: (1) adults\\naged 18 years or older, (2) English fluency and literacy, and (3) identification as a primary\\nfamily caregiver for an eligible patient. As per criterion #3, only one caregiver who\\nidentified as the “primary family caregiver” was eligible for inclusion.\\nPatients and caregivers who consented to participation completed self-report measures on\\ndemographic information, psychosocial resilience, and psychiatric symptoms at the time of\\nenrollment. At 3- and 6-month post-discharge, dyads were contacted via email to complete\\nfollow-up psychosocial measures using REDCap, a secure online data capture software [24].\\nMeasures\\nPatient and Caregiver Demographics—During enrollment, patients and caregivers\\nreported age, sex, ethnicity, race, marital status, education, employment status, and\\nrelationship to each other. Data were collected on admission diagnosis, need for intubation\\nduring hospital stay, and discharge location.\\nAnxiety Symptoms—Anxiety symptoms were measured via the anxiety subscale of the\\nHospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-A) [25], a widely used and reliable measure\\namong medical populations [26]. Patients reported the frequency of anxiety symptoms\\nduring the past week on a scale from 0 (“Not at all”) to 3 (“Very much” or “Most of the\\ntime”). Seven items on the anxiety subscale are then summed (range 0–21), with higher\\nscores representing greater anxiety symptoms. In our analysis, we considered scores ≥ 8\\nto be clinically significant mild, moderate, and severe anxiety symptoms [26] and used\\nthe higher cut-off of ≥ 11 to characterize clinically significant moderate or severe anxiety\\nsymptoms. Anxiety symptoms were measured during Neuro-ICU admission and at 3- and\\n6-month follow-up.\\nResiliency Factors\\nMindfulness: The extent to which individuals apply general concepts of mindfulness was\\nmeasured via the Cognitive Affective Mindfulness Scale-Revised (CAMS-R) [27]. The\\nscale’s 12 items asking about engagement in mindfulness are scored on a scale from 1\\n(“rarely” or “not at all”) to 4 (“almost” or “always”). Scores are then summed (range\\n12–48), with higher scores representing greater utilization of mindfulness techniques. The\\nMeyers et al.\\nPage 4\\nNeurocrit Care. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2025 May 06.\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nCAMS-R is a reliable and valid scale that has been used in prior studies in neurocritical care\\npopulations [13, 28], as well as with other medical populations of patients and caregivers\\n[29] It was administered during Neuro-ICU admission.\\nCoping: Coping skills were measured via the Measure of Current Status-Part A (MOCS-A)\\n[30], in which 13 items assess confidence in skills related to relaxation and behavioral and\\ncognitive responses to stressful thoughts or situations. Items are scored on a scale from 0\\n(“I cannot do this at all”) to 4 (“I can do this extremely well”). The items are summed\\n(range 0–52), and higher scores suggest better utilization of coping skills. The MOCS-A is\\na reliable and valid scale that has been used in prior studies in neurocritical care populations\\n[13, 28] as well as with other medical populations of patients and caregivers [31]. It was\\nadministered during Neuro-ICU admission.\\nStatistical Analysis\\nWe summarized participant characteristics with measures of central tendency (e.g.,\\nproportion, mean). Univariate tests (Pearson r, Chi-square, and paired sample t tests)\\nbetween patient and caregiver variables were used as appropriate. Two-tailed tests were\\nused to utilize to more conservatively identify statistical differences between participant\\ncharacteristics. Statistical significance was determined with two-tailed tests and an -level of\\n0.05. Effect size was determined to be small, medium, or large based on Pearson r values of\\n0.10, 0.30, and 0.50 [32].\\nWe used actor–partner interdependence modeling (APIM) to test impact of resilience and\\nanxiety symptoms on individuals and their partners [33, 34]. This analysis models the\\ncontribution of one dyad member’s predictors on his/her own outcome and simultaneously\\non his/her partner’s outcome, while accounting for the correlation between dyad members’\\ndata. In the current study, an “actor effect” refers to the relationship between a person’s\\nbaseline measures (resiliency factors and anxiety) with his/her own anxiety symptoms at\\nfollow-up. A “partner effect” refers to the relationship between a person’s baseline measures\\n(resiliency factors and anxiety) and his/her “partner’s” (i.e., the other dyad member’s)\\nanxiety symptoms at follow-up. Contrast tests were used to determine whether patient\\nand caregiver actor and partner effects were equivalent. If contrast tests yielded p < 0.05,\\npatient and caregiver effects were considered significantly different and were interpreted\\nseparately. If contrast tests yielded p > 0.05, patient and caregiver effects were considered\\nnot significantly different and a pooled effect was interpreted.\\nIn following recommendations from the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute\\n[35], we used multiple imputations with fully conditional specification to account for\\nuncompleted measures [36] and created 40 imputed datasets. All analyses were performed\\nusing SPSS Version 24 [37].\\nResults\\nParticipant Characteristics\\nOur prospective cohort consisted of 114 patient–caregiver dyads. Of these, 102 patients\\n(89%) and 103 caregivers (90%) completed study measures and were included in the\\nMeyers et al.\\nPage 5\\nNeurocrit Care.

Excluded individuals signed informed consent but did not complete study\\nmeasures. The included patients and caregivers are from 108 unique dyads, with 96\\ncomplete patient–caregiver dyads (i.e., completed study measures by both the patient and\\ncaregiver), six patients without caregivers, and six caregivers without patients represented.\\nRates of psychosocial measure completion were 94% at baseline, 77% at 3 months, and 71%\\nat 6 months.\\nTable 1 summarizes demographic and medical characteristics. Both patients and caregivers\\nwere on average middle aged. The majority were white and completed some college\\neducation. There was a higher proportion of females to males and married/cohabitating\\nindividuals among the caregivers compared to patients. Cerebrovascular diseases, including\\nischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, were the most common neurological diagnoses, followed\\nby intracranial tumors or other structural lesions. The most common patient–caregiver\\nrelationship was spouse/partners. Intubation was used as a proxy for disease severity.\\nSeventy-six percent of patients were intubated at any point during their hospitalization; 22%\\nof patients were intubated for a reason other than surgery. Indications for intubation included\\nstatus epilepticus, neurological worsening leading to altered mental status, myasthenia gravis\\nexacerbation, and hypercarbic respiratory failure unrelated to neurological injury.\\nResiliency Factors and Anxiety Symptoms\\nPatient and caregiver resiliency factors and anxiety symptom severity are summarized in\\nTable 2. There were no differences in mindfulness and coping scores between patients and\\ncaregivers (t(1377) = −0.79 and t (653) = −0.27, respectively, p > 0.42). Rates of clinically\\nsignificant moderate or severe anxiety symptoms were high and were similar for patients\\nand caregivers at baseline (χ2 (1) = 0.6, p = 0.49). At 3- and 6-month follow-up, rates\\nof clinically significant symptoms in patients slightly increased, while rates in caregivers\\nslightly decreased. Overall, patients were more likely than caregivers to report moderate to\\nsevere anxiety symptoms at 3-month (χ2(1) = 9.01, p < 0.001) and 6-month follow-up (χ2\\n(1) = 9.82, p = 0.002). Mean HADS-A score did not differ based on sex, age, race (white vs\\nnon-white), ethnicity (Hispanic vs. non-Hispanic), marital status, or education level (all ps\\n> 0.09). There was no difference in mean HADS-A scores between patients with vascular,\\nstructural, or other types of diagnoses (ps > 0.06), between patients who were intubated\\nand patients who were not intubated (ps > 0.1), and between family caregivers of intubated\\npatients and non-intubated patients (ps > 0.2). Individuals with a self-reported prior mental\\nhealth history had greater HADS-A scores (M = 10.17) than those without (M = 6.62; t =\\n−3.04, p = 0.002) at baseline and at 6 months (M = 8.99 vs. M = 6.01; t = −1.99, p = 0.047).\\nEffects of Own Psychological Factors on Own Anxiety Symptoms (Actor Effects)\\nBivariate Analysis—Bivariate correlations between resilience scores and anxiety\\nsymptoms are presented in Table 3.

The\\nimpact of baseline anxiety symptoms on symptoms at 3 months was greater in caregivers\\nthan patients (β = 0.732 and β = 0.471, respectively).

Moderate to severe\\nanxiety symptoms were present in 20% of patients and 23% of caregivers. These high\\nrates of clinically significant symptoms remained relatively stable for patients and decreased\\nslightly for caregivers. At 6 months after hospitalization, one in three patients and caregivers\\nreported clinically significant anxiety symptoms.\\nThe present findings are in line with previous cross-sectional work detailing high rates\\nof clinically significant anxiety in the Neuro-ICU for both patients and caregivers [3]. As\\nhypothesized, for both patients and caregivers, an individuals’ elevated anxiety symptoms\\nduring Neuro-ICU admission were predictive of higher levels of chronic anxiety symptoms\\npost-discharge. The chronicity of anxiety symptoms and the predictive relationship of\\nbaseline anxiety on follow-up anxiety have been observed in non-neurocritical care\\npopulations as well. In bariatric surgery patients, while preoperative depressive symptoms\\nsignificantly decreased over time, preoperative anxiety symptoms remained stable through\\n24–36 month post-op. More so, preoperative anxiety symptoms significantly predicted 6–\\n12-month and 24–36-month post-operative anxiety [38]. In survivors of acute myocardial\\ninfarction, anxiety scores at discharge and at 3-month follow-up were the sole predictors of\\nanxiety at 18-month follow-up after adjusting for a number of demographic and lifestyle\\nfactors [39]. While the relationship between baseline and follow-up anxiety may seem\\nobvious, maintaining elevated levels of anxiety symptoms beyond hospitalization is not\\ntrivial; rather, it is indicative of chronic anxiety that may have serious implications for\\nsurvivors’ and caregivers’ quality of life and/or functional status. Clinically, the importance\\nof chronic anxiety cannot be understated, as it has been associated with more adverse\\nMeyers et al.\\nPage 7\\nNeurocrit Care.

Emotional\\nstrain has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality for caregivers [40]. As\\nthe predictive nature of baseline anxiety on follow-up anxiety may certainly not be specific\\nto neurocritical care populations, it is important that these symptoms are monitored and\\naddressed across ICU and hospital settings.\\nInterestingly, baseline anxiety symptom levels were a stronger predictor of 3-month anxiety\\nin caregivers than in patients, suggesting that caregivers’ anxiety is particularly likely to\\nmaintain if endorsed during the patient’s hospitalization. As emotional distress in caregivers\\ncan prevent them from delivering high-quality care [41], both dyad members may suffer\\nif caregivers experience high levels of anxiety in the crucial early days of the recovery\\nprocess. Regardless of dyad member, given the elevated risk of adverse cerebrovascular\\nevents associated with chronic anxiety [9], early intervention may thus be warranted to\\nprevent further adverse events in an already vulnerable population.\\nPatients’ and caregivers’ levels of mindfulness and adaptive coping measured at the time\\nof the patient’s admission to the Neuro-ICU were associated with lower own anxiety\\nsymptoms—both concurrently at admission and prospectively over the 6 months following\\nadmission. These modifiable resilience factors have been tied to improved health outcomes\\nin a number of medical populations [15–17]. In the Neuro-ICU, cross-sectional studies\\nhave demonstrated that greater mindfulness is associated with lower psychiatric symptoms\\nin patients [3] and greater quality of life in their caregivers [42]. The present findings\\ncontribute longitudinal data to this growing evidence base in this population. Elucidating\\nthe protective qualities of mindfulness and adaptive coping may be particularly important\\nin Neuro-ICU populations, as patients often face a lengthy recovery process, with deficits\\npersisting well beyond discharge [43, 44]. Psychotherapeutic interventions that bolster these\\nresilience factors to help patients and caregivers accept the chronic often uncertain nature of\\ntheir deficits and engage in adaptive coping may lead to better adjustment post-Neuro-ICU\\nstay. Of note, the benefits of mindfulness and adaptive coping on anxiety may not be specific\\nto neurocritical care populations. In the absence of direct comparative evidence with other\\ndisease populations, the relative protectiveness of mindfulness and adaptive coping cannot\\nbe derived from our study. We suggest continued research efforts in examining the protective\\nnature of mindfulness and adaptive coping in other medical populations, so as to identify\\nspecific populations that benefit from these resilience factors.\\nThe dyadic modeling used in this analysis [34] examined how one individual’s resilience\\nor anxiety symptoms at hospitalization can not only impact their anxiety trajectory, but also\\nthe effects these factors can have on one’s partner’s anxiety. The previous cross-sectional\\nresearch using APIM to look at resilience factors and psychological distress in Neuro-ICU\\npatient–caregiver dyads demonstrated that for both patients and caregivers, higher levels of\\nmindfulness in one dyad member are associated with lower levels of depressive symptoms\\nin their partner at the time of hospital admission [3]. The present study builds upon\\nthese findings, showing that when a patient or caregiver endorsed greater mindfulness\\nat Neuro-ICU admission, their partner reported lower anxiety symptoms 3 months later.\\nThe prospective partner effect of mindfulness on anxiety did not, however, extend to\\nanxiety symptoms at 6 months. It is possible that heightened anxiety symptoms after 3\\nMeyers et al.\\nPage 8\\nNeurocrit Care. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2025 May 06.\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nmonths may be more chronic and stable. Indeed, our analysis showed that 3-month anxiety\\nwas a stronger predictor of 6-month anxiety than baseline anxiety was of anxiety at 3\\nmonths. However, a more mindful partner may still be protective long term, as lower\\nlevels of anxiety at 3 months predict less future anxiety. These findings highlight the\\nimportance of dyadic modeling in critically ill patients and their caregivers by demonstrating\\ninterdependent protective factors (i.e., mindfulness-based practices) that can be utilized in\\nearly interventions. While APIM analysis reveals partner effects while controlling for actor\\neffects and therefore produces a conservative estimate, further work is needed to replicate\\nthese results.\\nThe present findings, in conjunction with a growing evidence on psychosocial factors in\\nNeuro-ICU patients and caregivers [3, 13, 42], have important clinical implications. First,\\nsince those with clinically significant anxiety during the hospitalization are at high risk\\nof developing chronic anxiety through 6 months, and mindfulness and adaptive coping at\\nhospitalization are associated with less severe anxiety symptoms, an early intervention that\\nstarts in the hospital, continues through discharge, and teaches mindfulness-based practices\\nand adaptive coping strategies may prevent the development of chronic anxiety in Neuro-\\nICU patients and their family caregivers. Second, since an individual’s higher mindfulness\\nearly in the hospitalization is associated with lower anxiety in their partner at 3 months,\\nthe most promising interventions are likely dyad-based (i.e., patient and caregiver together).\\nQualitatively, patients and caregivers confirm experiencing high anxiety in the Neuro-ICU\\nand express interest in participating in an early dyadic intervention aimed at preventing\\nchronic emotional distress [45].\\nThese findings contribute to a larger conversation taking place in the critical care literature\\nabout post-intensive care syndrome (PICS), a constellation of physical, cognitive, and\\npsychiatric symptoms that persist after an ICU stay [46]. While characterizing PICS in the\\ncontext of the neurological sequalae experienced by Neuro-ICU patients can be challenging,\\nand this investigation looks at only one facet of this multidimensional condition, our findings\\nare in line with rates of anxiety previously reported in the Neuro-ICU PICS literature [47].\\nPerhaps more significantly, the high rates of anxiety seen in caregivers in our study speaks\\nto the concept of PICS-F, or the psychological ramifications of ICU hospitalization for\\nthe family members of the critically ill [46]. The role of psychological resilience factors\\nand their interdependence between patients and caregivers suggests a potential avenue for\\nprevention and treatment of PICS and PICS-F.\\nOur study is not without limitations. First, as only dyads in which patients had intact\\ncognitive functioning were included, our findings cannot be generalized to all patient–\\ncaregiver dyads admitted to the Neuro-ICU, particularly the most severely impaired patients.\\nFuture inquiries should examine the trajectory of anxiety symptoms in caregivers of patients\\nof worse cognitive status, after accounting for admission anxiety symptoms and resiliency\\nfactors. Next, although participants completed the self-report measures privately, there was\\nstill potential for positive response bias. Additionally, the present analysis includes limited\\nclinical data on the patients’ hospital course, including duration of and reason for intubation.\\nFuture studies should incorporate indication for and duration of intubation. Finally, our\\nMeyers et al.\\nPage 9\\nNeurocrit Care.

The severity of individuals’ anxiety symptoms, as well\\nas usage of mindfulness and adaptive coping strategies, was directly linked to one’s own\\ndevelopment of chronic anxiety post-discharge. Between dyad members, mindfulness-based\\npractices had a protectively interdependent effect on the development of anxiety at 3 months.\\nHowever, this effect is not present at 6-month follow-up.

As re-\\nsearch from general critical care shows, families are\\npropelled into the role of caregiver and surrogate deci-\\nsion-maker, both with extreme levels of responsibility\\nfor which they are often unprepared, creating signifi-\\ncant emotional burden as they deal with the patient’s\\ncritical illness and uncertain recovery (3–5).\\nInterventions to support families as surrogate deci-\\nsion-makers exist but have failed to mitigate long-\\nterm psychologic distress (6, 7). Experts have argued\\nthat supporting families in their surrogate deci-\\nsion-making role alone is not enough; families require\\nadditional strategies to reduce long-term emotional\\neffects (8). Families of patients with SABI also have\\nunique additional stressors that limit generalizations\\nfrom nonbrain injured populations. SABI is typically\\nvery sudden and unexpected, and it carries high po-\\ntential for lifelong disability and substantial prognostic\\nuncertainty during the early period of illness (9–11).\\nComprehensive assessments of family experiences\\nafter SABI and families’ specific needs for emotional,\\nphysical, and spiritual support are lacking.\\nOur primary objective was to understand the expe-\\nriences and needs of families of patients with SABI\\nfrom the perspectives of multiple stakeholders. These\\nfindings will inform future interventions to support\\nfamilies after SABI, diminish psychologic distress of\\nfamilies struggling with the surrogate role, and guide\\nclinicians and hospitals in providing patient- and fam-\\nily-centered care. We focused on the early hospitaliza-\\ntion when emotional shock, prognostic uncertainty,\\nand acute stress prevail. We aimed to examine: 1) the\\ninformation families of SABI patients needed and re-\\nceived, 2) how information was communicated, and 3)\\nfamilies’ emotional, physical, and spiritual needs.\\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\\nWe conducted a two-phase qualitative study of families\\nof comatose patients hospitalized after cardiac arrest\\nor sTBI and healthcare professionals who care for this\\npatient population. Phase 1 was a single-site study\\nusing individual semistructured interviews to generate\\nformative findings. Phase 2 was a virtual workshop\\nbringing together a national purposive sample of stake-\\nholders to further explore and expand on findings from\\nphase 1. This combination of both phases with multiple\\ndata sources was designed to facilitate triangulation and\\nto increase trustworthiness of the data. Participants in-\\ncluded family members of survivors and nonsurvivors,\\nand healthcare professionals, including emergency\\nmedicine and critical care physicians, researchers,\\nparamedics, critical care nurses, chaplains, and social\\nworkers. The study team was assembled to include four\\ncochairs with expertise in neuroprognostication, surro-\\ngate decision-making, and emergency research, supple-\\nmented by two methodologic experts in medical ethics\\nand qualitative research. Five qualitative researchers\\nfrom Westat, a health, statistical, and social science re-\\nsearch organization headquartered in Rockville, MD,\\ndrafted interview and workshop discussion guides,\\nconducted interviews, facilitated workshop discus-\\nsions, and analyzed data. The Westat research team was\\ncomposed of four research staff experienced in mixed\\nmethods research under the supervision of a Project\\nDirector with doctoral training in Developmental\\nPsychology. Study procedures were supported by an ad-\\nministrative supplement to the “Strategies to Innovate\\nEmeRgENcy Care Clinical Trials Network,” a clinical\\ntrials network focused upon improving the outcomes\\nof patients with neurologic, cardiac, respiratory, and\\nhematologic emergencies by identifying effective treat-\\nments given in the earliest stages of care. All study pro-\\ncedures were reviewed and deemed exempt for further\\nreview by the Westat Institutional Review Board (Date\\nof approval: February 25, 2019).\\nPhase 1: Family, Clinician, and Ancillary Staff\\nMember Interviews\\nSetting and Study Population.. We conducted one-\\non-one semistructured interviews with participants\\nfrom a single academic medical center intentionally\\nsampled for its experience with postcardiac arrest and\\nsTBI care. Participants included family members of\\npatients with cardiac arrest and sTBI, clinicians, and\\nancillary staff. We purposively sampled each group\\nto ensure diversity by race/ethnicity, gender, and spe-\\ncialty. Given the highly sensitive nature of the research\\nand challenges of recruiting, we asked clinicians to\\nidentify family members with whom they had existing\\nclinical relationships.\\nData Collection, Management, and Analysis.\\nThe research team developed interview guides with\\nOriginal Clinical Report\\nCritical Care Explorations\\nwww.ccejournal.org\\n3\\nopen-ended questions (Supplementary Digital\\nContent 1, http://links.lww.com/CCX/A939) fo-\\ncusing on our three major study questions. Hour-long\\ninterviews were conducted with healthcare profes-\\nsional participants in July-August 2020 and with\\nfamily member participants in August-October 2020.\\nAll interviews were conducted telephonically and\\nwere led by a Westat qualitative researcher. A second\\nWestat staff member took notes and served as an ob-\\nserver during each interview. Interviews were audio-\\nrecorded, professionally transcribed, and imported\\ninto NVivo11 (QSR International Pty Ltd. 2017).\\nWestat developed a codebook using both a deductive\\nand inductive analysis approach. The initial codebook\\nwas structured around a framework that focused on\\nfamilies’ experiences within five domains based on an\\necological model adapted from National Institute on\\nMinority Health and Health Disparities (12) (Fig. 1).\\nThe core concept of ecological models is that health\\nbehaviors have multiple levels of influences (social,\\npsychologic, environmental, public policies, etc.) and\\nare often used as frameworks for understanding these\\ninteracting factors of health behaviors (13). The code-\\nbook was then refined inductively through iterative\\nreview of the data and sharing of emerging thematic\\ncontent among the coders. Discrepancies were re-\\nsolved by consensus.\\nPhase 2: Virtual Workshop\\nWe conducted a virtual workshop on November 19,\\n2020, to confirm the initial findings from families and\\nproviders with multiple stakeholders, capture missing\\nthemes, and expand upon themes identified during\\nphase 1.\\nSetting and Study Population. The cochairs identi-\\nfied 30 invitees from across the United States: 18 family\\nmembers and 12 healthcare professionals. We created\\na purposeful sample of U.S. healthcare professionals\\nbased on their known expertise in the care of patients\\nwith SABI, and their engagement in research focused\\non families of SABI patients. We chose family member\\nparticipants to maximize representation by gender,\\nrace, and patient’s disease and survival status among\\nfamily participants. Family members were identified\\nby study cochairs, healthcare professionals who were\\nrecruited as participants, and a national organization\\nwith a survivor/caregiver network (Sudden Cardiac\\nArrest Foundation, Wexford, PA, www.sca-aware.org).\\nWe used snowball sampling to further identify family\\nparticipants from these initial individuals.

The analysts\\nlooked for any disconfirming findings, expanded\\nunderstandings, and confirmation from the previous\\nfindings.\\nTriangulation of Findings From Phase 1. Data\\nwere analyzed to produce summative themes related\\nto family members’ needs and categorized according\\nto domains within the research framework. We also\\nassembled strategies used by hospital staff and insti-\\ntutions or recommended by families to address these\\nneeds. We considered findings transferable if they were\\ngenerated in phase 1 and supported in phase 2. We\\nadded new themes or subthemes that emerged from\\nthe workshop to the overarching analytic framework.\\nRESULTS\\nIn phase 1, 19 participants were interviewed (seven\\nfamily members and 12 healthcare professionals).\\nIn phase 2, of 30 individuals invited, 29 participated\\nin the workshop (17 family members and 12 health-\\ncare professionals). Table 1 displays the participant\\ncharacteristics.\\nWe categorized findings by domains according to\\nthe analytical framework (Fig. 1). Although the intent\\nwas to examine the first 48 hours of the patient’s admis-\\nsion, many family members discussed needs beyond\\nthis time period. Representative quotes for all domains\\nare shown in Table 2. Complete domains from both\\nphases are shown in Supplementary Digital Contents\\n4–8 (http://links.lww.com/CCX/A939).\\nDomain 1: Information Needs\\nFamily members reported a need for information\\nabout their loved one’s (LO’s) disease progression and\\npossible outcomes, especially if the injury or condi-\\ntion may be fatal or seriously impact quality of life.\\nFamily members also expressed a need for informa-\\ntion about their LO’s care plans and test results and\\nexpressed frustration when updates were not received\\nin a timely manner. They expressed logistical con-\\ncerns related to contacting the care team. To support\\ninformed decision-making, families commented on\\nthe importance of receiving clear information about\\noptions, including therapies and treatments. Families\\ndiscussed that they clarified their understanding\\nthrough trusted and knowledgeable resources\\n(friends, family, or established physician relation-\\nships). Many participants discussed their reliance on\\npersonal contacts in the medical field to help them\\nmake decisions. Searching the internet was described\\nas “overwhelming” for families. Finally, families dis-\\ncussed their need for hospital staff to share infor-\\nmation about what to expect in transitions from the\\nemergency department (ED) to ICU, as well as to dif-\\nferent postdischarge care settings.\\nHealthcare professionals in both phases of the re-\\nsearch discussed the physicians’ responsibility to com-\\nmunicate uncertainty honestly to families without\\ndeclaring premature conclusions, which can have dele-\\nterious effects on patient outcomes (i.e., a self-fulfilling\\nprophecy). They noted variation across physicians in\\ncommunicating uncertainty.\\nDomain 2: Communication Needs\\nFamilies emphasized the need for healthcare profes-\\nsionals to be clear, consistent, and compassionate in\\ntheir communication, particularly when delivering bad\\nnews.

Some\\nfamilies experienced consulting clinicians commu-\\nnicating in “siloes,” indicating a perceived lack of co-\\nordination with the primary team. A holistic team\\nfunctioning collectively, in communication with one\\nanother, provides more consistent information to fam-\\nilies. Healthcare professionals confirmed the impor-\\ntance of communicating with compassion to families\\nand emphasized the importance of spending time with\\nfamilies to build trust. One healthcare professional re-\\nflected on the challenges of shift work and the poten-\\ntial for the impression of “disjointed” care teams.\\nDomain 3: Emotional Needs\\nFamilies experienced a range of feelings (shock, dis-\\ntress, confusion, and despair) as they attempted to\\ncope with their LOs’ critical illness. The unexpected\\nlife-threatening event, uncertainty regarding their\\nLO’s outcome, and reliance on the healthcare team for\\ncompassionate support contributed to their emotional\\nresponses. It was important to families that the health-\\ncare team genuinely cared for their LOs. They valued\\nthe care team frequently “checking-in” with updates,\\nbeing respectful and attentive, addressing questions,\\nand conveying empathy and compassion. Social\\nsupport from friends and family, as well as services\\noffered at the hospital, helped families deal with their\\nemotional overload.\\nRegarding prognostication, most families gener-\\nally desired explicit information on what to anticipate,\\nbut some expressed difficulty hearing about a pos-\\nsible poor prognosis. A few stated that they wished to\\nhear the range of possible outcomes, given the reality\\nof prognostic uncertainty and a desire to prepare for\\nthe worst, whereas others preferred this information\\nto remain hopeful. Several indicated that they were\\nunaware that death or poor quality of life were po-\\ntential outcomes. Conversely, physicians were more\\nlikely to express concern about providing inaccurate\\ninformation. Physicians also discussed the challenge of\\noverconfident colleagues when conveying prognosis.\\nDomain 4: Sociocultural Needs\\nDuring both study phases, families and healthcare\\nprofessionals emphasized the need for equitable treat-\\nment and socioculturally appropriate communication\\nto ensure that families feel respected and are treated\\nwithout bias. Participants noted that these vital factors\\ncontribute to effective and positive communication\\nand encourage rapport building between the families\\nand the care team. During the workshop in partic-\\nular, one family described negative experiences, such\\nas discriminatory care due to the family’s race. For in-\\nstance, some families felt disregarded, overlooked, and\\neven disrespected by some hospital staff whom they\\nperceived as racist. These families expressed hope that\\nsharing their experiences could improve how other\\nfamilies are cared for and stressed the importance of\\nproviding families an opportunity to reflect on their\\nexperiences.\\nDomain 5: Physical Needs\\nFamilies described needs related to physical, tangible,\\nor logistical issues, including the location and hours\\nof the cafeteria, visitor parking locations, and lodg-\\ning. Several families desired a comfortable private\\nspace within the hospital. The physical needs changed\\nover the first 48 hours, especially for those who had to\\ntravel emergently to be at their LO’s bedside. Families\\ndescribed being so focused on the status of their LO\\nthat many arrived at the hospital without remember-\\ning to bring personal belongings and other travel items\\nfor a stay of unknown duration. They wanted visitation\\nrules that allowed families to be with their LO around-\\nthe-clock and to be allowed to assist in cleaning and\\nbathing the patient as a way to connect with their LO.\\nCross-Cutting Themes\\nConsistent themes related to family experience emerged\\nfrom both phases and cut across all domains: 1) a\\ndesire for information about illness and prognosis for\\nrecovery and the challenges of uncertainty, 2) identify-\\ning gaps in provision of logistical information and sup-\\nport, 3) importance of communicating compassion,\\nsharing uncertainty, and responding to emotional and\\nMuehlschlegel et al\\n8\\nwww.ccejournal.org\\nMarch 2022 • Volume 4 • Number 3\\nphysical needs, and 4) a desire to participate in the dis-\\ncussion and development of practices to improve sup-\\nport for future families in similar situations.\\nKey Recommendations for Hospitals and Staff\\nWorkshop participants identified a number of strate-\\ngies to address the various needs of family members\\nduring the first 48 hours (Table 3). Three areas of focus\\nidentified by families included: 1) clear, compassionate,\\nand timely information about the patient’s status, ex-\\npectations, and care, 2) to feel respected and part of\\ntheir LO’s care team, and 3) various types of support\\nafter their LO is discharged from the hospital or dies.\\nRecommendations for actions hospital staff and insti-\\ntutions can do to alleviate these major concerns were\\ndiscussed by the group and detailed in Table 3.\\nDISCUSSION\\nIn this qualitative study, we elicited real-world, “on-\\nthe-ground” perspectives of families, multidiscipli-\\nnary clinical providers, advocates, and experienced\\nresearchers. This approach bringing multiple stake-\\nholders together presents novel insights regarding\\nemergency and critical care in SABI. Our findings\\naddress the call to better understand families’ experi-\\nences in SABI and to illuminate factors that contribute\\nquality of decision-making and long-term patient and\\nfamily physical and emotional outcomes (9, 14, 15).\\nOur findings underscore the need to include fami-\\nlies in discussions on how to improve care for SABI\\npatients and emphasize the need for institutional sup-\\nport to the entire family unit.\\nOur study confirms and extends prior findings from\\nsTBI (9) but also provides recommendations formu-\\nlated by key stakeholders to enhance the care of fami-\\nlies in their times of crisis. Implementation of these\\nrecommendations could improve family experience\\nand also help healthcare providers, who experience the\\nstress of caring for critically ill patients and families on\\nthe worst day of their lives.\\nBy design, our study contrasted the perceptions and\\nneeds of families with the experience of healthcare\\nproviders. Families repeatedly emphasized the need\\nfor direct, timely, and consistent information from cli-\\nnicians that is presented empathically. Although the\\nneed to “communicate uncertainty with directness”\\nwas mentioned by families, it did not rise to the top\\nof their needs. However, especially among physicians,\\nthe topic of communicating uncertainty around neu-\\nroprognostication was a repeated focus of discussion.\\nThe source of this discordance may stem from physi-\\ncians’ reluctance to disclose uncertainty and their per-\\nception that discussing prognostic uncertainty with\\nfamilies is “harmful” (10, 16–19). Concomitantly, phy-\\nsicians raised concern that families do not understand\\nuncertainty. Previous research on family perspectives\\nabout uncertainty is mixed. One study indicates a lack\\nof awareness among families of prognostic uncertainty\\n(20), whereas other studies in both general critical care\\nand sTBI have found that families are quite aware of\\nprognostic uncertainty, finding it “unavoidable” and\\n“inherently present” (10, 16). Our findings suggest that\\nphysicians should focus on clear and honest commu-\\nnication, including directly acknowledging and stating\\nthat uncertainty exists.\\nOne notable observation in our study was the will-\\ningness of families to collaborate and use their expe-\\nriences to improve care for others. Such patient and\\nfamily partnerships have had positive impact on clin-\\nical care and prioritization of research questions, while\\nbeing highly valued by the patients, families, and many\\nparticipating clinicians (9, 14, 21). Similarly, in our\\nstudy, stakeholders illuminated blind spots within sys-\\ntems of care, for example, the need for care teams to\\ncommunicate with each other to provide uniform in-\\nformation to families. The clinicians participating in\\nour study endorsed the value of families’ experiences\\nand embraced the opportunity to improve patient- and\\nfamily-centered care.\\nOur study has notable strengths and limitations.\\nWe conducted an in-depth phase within a single set-\\nting first, followed by a phase with a broad geographic\\nrepresentation. Cardiac arrest and sTBI are common\\nand emblematic diseases among SABI; therefore, our\\nfindings are likely transferable to other catastrophic\\nneurologic emergencies. Additionally, the workshop\\nafforded a unique opportunity to bring families and\\nhealthcare providers into a shared discussion and to\\nengage in dialogue raising awareness of the need to im-\\nprove support for families.\\nDespite extensive efforts to enroll participants di-\\nverse in gender, race, and roles, the family participants\\nwere predominantly highly educated, non-Hispanic\\nWhite women.

       " 'Introduction\\nAdmission to the neurological intensive care unit (neuro-ICU) is often an unexpected and\\ntraumatic event for both patients and their informal caregivers (i.e. family and/or friends who\\nprovide instrumental and emotional support (1) and many develop clinically significant\\nposttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms during the hospitalization (patients: 21%\\ninformal caregivers: 17%) (2,3). These rates are particularly alarming, as elevated PTSD\\nsymptoms have been linked to increased risk of mortality in other critically ill populations\\n(4).\\nQuality of life (QoL) is an individual’s perceived position in life relative to their values,\\ngoals, standards, and expectations (5). QoL is an important outcome for both neurocritical\\ncare patients, who have to adjust to potential cognitive, emotional, and physical health\\nconsequences of their acute brain injury, and caregivers who must juggle their own life\\nresponsibilities with the sudden challenges that accompany their loved one’s condition (e.g.\\nrole changing, uncertainty of loved one’s prognosis, alteration of future plans, etc.) (6).\\nPrevious research has shown that the cognitive and physical effects of the acute neurological\\ninjury are not enough to explain the poor QoL experienced by patients and caregivers (7,8).\\nPTSD symptoms experienced during hospitalization may be implicated in poor quality of\\nlife in both neurocritical care patients and caregivers, though these relationships have yet to\\nbe adequately explored. In survivors of various acute cerebrovascular accidents, recent\\nresearch has uncovered that PTSD symptoms are cross-sectionally and prospectively\\nassociated with lower QoL and greater physical disability (9–12). In caregivers, a prior\\ncross-sectional study by Zale et al (13) found that greater caregiver anxiety and depression\\nscores were associated with worse physical, psychological, and social QoL during the\\nPresciutti et al.\\nPage 2\\nNeurocrit Care. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 February 01.\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\npatient’s neuro-ICU admission. Although this study did not examine PTSD symptoms\\nspecifically, it does highlight the importance of psychological symptoms when considering\\nQoL in caregivers of neuro-ICU patients. Further study is needed to understand the role of\\nearly PTSD in future QoL of both patients and caregivers.\\nPrior work has shown that PTSD symptom presentations are quite heterogenous (14). As\\nsuch, recent efforts have started to examine correlates of PTSD symptom clusters or\\ndimensions (4,15–18) in order to inform the development of targeted interventions. The 4-\\nfactor numbing model of PTSD symptom dimensions for intrusive re-experiencing, effortful\\navoidance, emotional numbing, and hyperarousal, and has an established evidence base for\\nits characterization of PTSD symptoms (19,20), including PTSD in a neurologically\\ncompromised cohort of cardiac arrest survivors (17). Importantly, however, potential\\ncorrelates of these PTSD symptoms, such as QoL, have yet to be examined. Thus,\\nidentifying the specific lower-order PTSD dimensions associated with future impairments in\\nQoL is an important first step in developing targeted interventions to improve QoL for\\nneurocritical care patients and caregivers.\\nIllness in the neuro-ICU can be quite heterogeneous, and the limitations that neurological\\ndisease impose complicate psychological research methods in neuro-ICU populations. As\\nsuch, the present study pilot tested the feasibility of assessing PTSD symptoms experienced\\nin the neuro-ICU and their relationship with QoL in both patients and caregivers. We first\\nexamined the prospective association of total PTSD symptoms with domains of QoL among\\nboth neurocritical care patients and caregivers. Our primary hypothesis was that higher\\nPTSD symptom scores at hospitalization would predict lower QoL scores 3 months later, for\\nboth patients and caregivers. Secondary analysis explored differential associations between\\nspecific PTSD symptom dimensions (as characterized by 4-factor numbing model) and QoL\\ndomains, for both patients and caregivers.\\nMethods\\nSample and Design\\nThe present study is a subgroup analysis within a larger prospective, longitudinal, cohort\\nstudy of dyads of patients and caregivers of patients admitted to the neuro-ICU at a large,\\ntertiary, academic medical center in Boston, MA. Data collection took place between 2015–\\n2016 and was approved by the local institutional review board.\\nThe full recruitment and enrollment protocol has been described previously (2). Briefly,\\ninclusion criteria for patients were as follows: 1) aged 18 years or older, 2) exhibited English\\nfluency and literacy, and 3) hospitalized to the Neuro-ICU within the previous 2-weeks.\\nPatients were excluded if they were deemed unable to provide consent due to cognitive\\nimpairment, had severe aphasia or cognitive impairment that prohibited full participation,\\nhad permanent cognitive impairment, anticipated death, or did not have an informal\\ncaregiver. Patients with transient aphasia or mild cognitive symptoms who were oriented and\\ncommunicative at the time of consent were considered medically able to participate. All\\neligible patients were cleared for participation by the medical team. Informal caregivers\\nwere eligible to participate if they met the following criteria: 1) aged 18 years or older, 2)\\nPresciutti et al.\\nPage 3\\nNeurocrit Care.

As per criterion #3, only the caregiver who identified as the “primary\\ncaregiver” was eligible for inclusion, and only caregivers of patients who achieved\\nneurological normalization were included.\\nPatients and caregivers who consented to participation completed self-report measures of\\ndemographic information and psychiatric symptoms at the time of enrollment (i.e. within the\\nfirst 2-weeks of neuro-ICU admission). At 3-months post-discharge, patients and caregivers\\nwere contacted via email to complete follow-up QoL measures using REDCap, a secure\\nonline data capture software (21). The analytic sample for the current study included data\\nfrom 70 patients and 64 caregivers (see Figure 1 for flow chart); the data were not paired and\\nthus two different datasets were used for analysis.\\nMeasures\\nPosttraumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms in Response to Neuro-ICU\\nAdmission—PTSD symptoms was measured via the PTSD Checklist-Specific (PCL-S)\\n(22) to assess symptom severity for all 17 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental\\nDisorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) symptoms for PTSD (23) during neuro-ICU admission.\\nPatients and caregivers rated the degree to which they experienced each symptom in the past\\nmonth, with reference to “being admitted to the ICU” or “being a loved one of a patient\\nadmitted to the ICU” on a scale from 1 (“Not at all”) to 5 (“Extremely”). The PCL-S has\\ndemonstrated acceptable test-retest reliability (24) and has shown to be excellently sensitive\\nand specific for identifying PTSD clinical diagnosis (25). For our primary analysis, we\\ncalculated total scaled scores from the PCL-S, which was then treated a continuous\\npredictor. For our secondary analysis, we created four continuous variables from total scaled\\nscores for each PTSD symptom dimension in the 4-factor numbing model of PTSD (i.e. re-\\nexperiencing, avoidance, numbing, hyperarousal). Because the four dimensions did not have\\nthe same scaled score ranges, we converted the total scaled scores to z-scores. Table 1\\npresents the allocation of each PCL-S item on respective symptom dimensions.\\nQuality of Life—Four domains of QoL were measured via the World Health Organization\\nQuality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF) (5). The WHOQOL-BREF is widely used as a\\npatient reported outcome measure for perceived quality of life across four domains\\n(physical, psychological, social, and environmental QoL). The physical QoL subscale\\nassesses perceived independence in activities of daily living, use of medical treatments, pain,\\nmobility, sleep, fatigue, and work capacity. The psychological QoL subscale assesses\\nexperience of both positive and negative emotions, cognitive function, self-esteem, meaning\\nmaking, and body image. The social QoL subscale examines satisfaction with and\\navailability of social support, and satisfaction with sex life. The environmental QoL subscale\\nexamines perceptions of one’s physical environment and availability of resources (e.g. safety\\nand security, opportunities for recreation, transportation). Individual items are rated on a 5-\\npoint scale, with higher scores indicating greater QoL. Domain scores were calculated from\\nrespective subscales according to published scoring recommendations (range 4−20) (26).\\nPresciutti et al.\\nPage 4\\nNeurocrit Care.

Because a large portion of our patients were diagnosed with a\\nstroke or hemorrhage, we dichotomized patient diagnosis into either having a stroke/\\nhemorrhage or having another diagnosis. Patient intubation was used as a proxy for disease\\nseverity. It should be noted, however, that intubation on its own is an inexact marker of\\ndisease severity; further intubation details such as reasons for intubation and length of\\nintubation are presented in Table 2.\\nStatistical Analysis Plan—We ran Fisher’s Exact and Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests as\\nappropriate to examine differences between patients and caregivers’ demographic variables,\\npatients’ medical variables, total scaled PTSD symptom scores, total scaled PTSD symptom\\ndimension scores, and QoL domain calculated scores. Next, we ran two bivariate correlation\\nmatrices between PTSD symptom dimension scores amongst patients and caregivers.\\nWe then conducted separate, identical statistical analyses for patients and caregivers, as these\\ndata were not paired. For our primary analysis, we ran a multiple linear regression model for\\neach QoL domain, with total PTSD symptom severity entered as the predictor, adjusted for\\nsex, age, race (white), patient diagnosis (stroke/hemorrhage), and intubation status.\\nCovariate selection was based on potential confounders of QoL in neuro-ICU populations as\\nidentified in the literature (9,27).\\nFor our secondary, exploratory, analysis, to examine the unique effect of PTSD symptom\\ndimensions on QoL, we ran a linear regression model for each QoL domain, with all four z-\\nscored PTSD symptom dimensions entered as predictors, adjusted for age and sex. Given\\nour sample size (patients n = 70; caregivers n = 64), only two demographic variables (age\\nand sex) were chosen as covariates so as to not overfit the models. All analyses were\\ncompleted using SPSS Version 25 (28).\\nResults\\nParticipant Characteristics\\nPatient and caregiver characteristics can be found in Table 2. There were no significant\\ndifferences between patients and caregivers in terms of demographics, total PTSD symptom\\nseverity, PTSD symptom dimension scaled scores, or QoL domain scores.\\nCorrelations between PTSD Symptom Dimensions\\nBivariate correlation matrices are presented in Table 3. All PTSD symptom dimensions were\\nmoderately-strongly correlated amongst patients (r = .65–.79, p < .001) and caregivers (r\\n= .55–.78, p < .001).\\nAssociations of Total PTSD Symptom Severity on Quality of Life Domains\\nFull details on the association between total PTSD symptom severity with QoL in patients\\nand caregivers are presented in Table 4.\\nPresciutti et al.\\nPage 5\\nNeurocrit Care.

No other symptom dimensions were associated with\\nQoL domains.\\nCaregivers—In adjusted models with all four symptom dimensions, age, and sex, greater\\nnumbing (β: − .409, p=.014) and re-experiencing (β: −.4, p=.041) symptoms were associated\\nwith lower physical QoL, and greater numbing symptoms was independently associated with\\nlower psychological (β: −.519, p = .001) and social QoL (β: −.704, p < .001). No other\\nsymptom dimensions were associated with QoL domains.\\nDiscussion\\nTo our knowledge, this was the first study to pilot test the feasibility of assessing PTSD\\nsymptoms experienced in the neuro-ICU and their relationship with 3-month QoL in both\\nneurologically intact patients and caregivers. Our preliminary findings demonstrated that for\\nboth patients and caregivers, higher total PTSD symptom scores significantly predicted\\nlower physical, psychological, social and environmental QoL at 3 months. In these models,\\nPTSD symptoms explained a small to moderate amount of variance in QoL domains. Our\\nsecondary, exploratory, analysis found that greater numbing symptoms predicted lower 3-\\nmonth physical, psychological, and social QoL in caregivers, and lower 3-month\\npsychological QoL in patients. Finally, greater re-experiencing was also predictive of lower\\n3-month physical QoL in both patients and caregivers. In each of these differential\\nassociations, a moderate to large amount of variance in QoL was explained by PTSD\\nsymptom dimensions.\\nOur finding that higher total PTSD symptom scores was prospectively associated with lower\\nQoL is consistent with prior research in neurocritical care patients (9) but extends this work\\nPresciutti et al.\\nPage 6\\nNeurocrit Care.

Thus, our results provide support for the\\nneed for early PTSD screening in both neurocritical care patients and caregivers, and the\\nneed for developing targeted PTSD interventions in order to improve QoL and recovery\\ntrajectories.\\nOur exploratory analysis, which demonstrated moderate to strong relationships between\\ngreater numbing symptoms and poor physical, psychological and social QoL in caregivers,\\nand poor psychological QoL in patients, suggests that interventions directly addressing\\nnumbing symptoms may be especially important in improving QoL, particularly in\\ncaregivers. Numbing has previously been conceptualized as a manifestation of maladaptive\\ncoping with the experience of intolerable re-experiencing, active avoidance, and\\nhyperarousal symptoms (29). Because emotional numbing involves decreasing awareness to\\ntrauma cues, it is conceptualized as the antithesis of mindfulness, which conversely involves\\nnon-judgmental, non-reactive awareness of the present moment (29). Importantly, in\\nneurocritical care patients and caregivers, higher mindfulness has been positively correlated\\nwith QoL (13). Further, a recent systematic review concluded that mindfulness-based\\ninterventions appear to be effective in treating PTSD (30). Taken together, these findings\\nsuggest that interventions that teach mindfulness skills have the potential to decrease\\nemotional numbing and subsequent risk for poor QoL in both neurocritical care patients and\\ncaregivers.\\nNotably, the associations between numbing with physical and social QoL in caregivers were\\nnot observed in patients. One explanation for this may be that while physical and social QoL\\nare expected to be impacted in patients who recently experienced a brain injury, caregivers\\ninstead must juggle their newfound caregiving responsibilities with their previous\\nresponsibilities. It is possible that the rigorous physical and temporal demands of caregiving\\nfor a neurologically compromised patient may lead to exacerbated numbing symptoms and\\nsubsequently reduced self-care, physical activity, and social interactions. Thus, reduced QoL\\nmay be an even greater concern for caregivers than for patients.\\nRegarding re-experiencing, greater symptoms in both patients and caregivers were\\nassociated with worse physical quality of life at 3-months. Even years after exposure to\\ntrauma, intrusive re-experiencing has been linked to an elevated physiological stress\\nresponse (31) and significantly greater risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in\\nsurvivors of acute coronary syndrome (4). When considering these previous studies, there\\nmay be a mechanistic link between re-experiencing with worsened physical QoL via\\nheightened cardiovascular reactivity to trauma cues. Continued study with relevant\\nbiomarkers is needed to confirm these mechanistic hypotheses in neurocritical care patients\\nand caregivers.\\nImportantly, no relationships between PTSD symptom dimensions and environmental QoL\\nwere observed, suggesting that no specific symptom dimension drives the total association\\nbetween PTSD symptoms and environmental QoL. Further study is needed to parse out the\\nrelationship between overall PTSD symptoms and environmental QoL in neuro-ICU\\npopulations.\\nPresciutti et al.\\nPage 7\\nNeurocrit Care.

First, given our small cohort with heterogenous neuro-\\nICU presentations, our findings must be considered preliminary and relevant only to\\nneurologically intact patients and caregivers. Second, in order to meet criteria for full PTSD\\ndiagnosis a minimum of 1 month must pass since the index trauma. In the present study,\\nPTSD symptoms were assessed within 2 weeks of neuro-ICU admission, thus participants\\nonly may have met PTSD criteria at the 3-month time point, but not at hospitalization.\\nNevertheless, we have found that PTSD symptoms present during the acute stage of neuro-\\nICU admission are predictive of subsequent PTSD symptoms at 3- and 6-months post-neuro-\\nICU admission (3). Importantly, given the highly dynamic and unpredictable nature of ICU\\nstay, assessment of PTSD symptoms during ICU admission but prior to 1 month has been\\nutilized in previous studies (2,3,12,17,18,32)). Next, given our moderate sample size, we\\nwere unable to conduct factor analyses on our cohort’s PTSD symptoms. As such, we\\ncompared our cohort’s PTSD symptoms to QoL using an established 4-factor model of\\nPTSD (19), which has previously been used to characterized neurologically compromised\\nsurvivors of cardiac arrest (17). Further, the present sample was predominantly white, and\\nthus our findings may not be generalizable to other racial groups. Additionally, intubation is\\nan inexact marker of illness severity and there is the possibility that re-experiencing and\\nnumbing may be more sensitive proxies of illness severity in this cohort. Thus, our findings\\nshould be considered with caution as elevations in these symptoms could be representative\\nof sicker patients. Next, it should be noted that depression and anxiety were not included in\\nour analyses, despite being important factors in QoL and being collected in the parent study\\n(via the Hospital Depression and Anxiety Scale; HADS). We found a strong correlation\\nbetween the PCL-C and HADS scores for both patients and caregivers (both r = .7, p <.001)\\nand thus we did not include the HADS in our final regression models. Importantly, when\\nincluding the HADS and PCL-S scores in the same models, the HADS consistently\\nexplained moderate variance across QoL subscales, while the PCL-S no longer demonstrated\\nstatistical significance. Because of the dramatic change in the PTSD coefficient when\\nincluding depression in the same model, previous papers have examined these two predictors\\nin separate models - one with the primary predictor variable being PTSD and one with the\\nprimary predictor variable being depression (33–35). Our models do not fully explain the\\nvariance in QoL post-NICU stay, though they do demonstrate the problematic association\\nbetween PTSD and QoL. Finally, dyads enrolled into the parent study only met inclusion if\\nthe patient was neurologically intact. There is potential that caregivers of severely\\nneurologically compromised patients may experience even worse PTSD symptoms and\\nlower QoL, and thus dedicated research efforts are needed for these caregivers.\\nConclusions\\nPTSD assessment during neuro-ICU admission and future QoL follow-up is feasible in both\\nneurologically intact patients and caregivers. Our preliminary findings indicated that greater\\nseverity of PTSD symptoms experienced by patients and caregivers during neuro-ICU\\nadmission were predictive of worse QoL 3 months later.

       " 'Introduction\\nAdmission to a neurological intensive care unit (Neuro-ICU) can be a sudden and stressful\\nevent for both patients and their caregivers (dyads), and depression and anxiety are common\\nin both Neuro-ICU patients and caregivers. Previously reported rates of clinically significant\\ndepression symptoms have ranged from 24 to 44% for patients and 24 to 55% for caregivers\\n[1–5]. Similarly, rates of clinically significant anxiety symptoms have ranged from 40 to\\n43% for patients and 42 to 46% for caregivers [1–4]. These rates are higher than those\\nobserved for other medical cohorts, including general ICU patients [6, 7] and caregivers\\n[8]. Prior research has shown that acute neurological injuries, such as stroke or transient\\nischemic attack [9–12], as well as intubation [3], increase risk for depression and anxiety\\nin patients. For caregivers, role changes and increased responsibilities [13], as well as\\nuncertainty about their loved one’s prognosis [14], also serve as important risk factors for\\ndepression and anxiety.\\nQuality of life (QoL), or an individual’s perceived well-being and standard of living, is an\\nimportant Neuro-ICU outcome given the physical, cognitive, and emotional implications\\nof brain injuries and subsequent life changes for both patients and caregivers [15–18]. In\\nsubarachnoid hemorrhage patients, 33% reported lower Psychological, Physical, and Social\\nrelationships QoL from 3- to 12-months post-discharge [12, 19] when compared with other\\nNeuro-ICU stroke and hemorrhage patients. Patient and caregiver psychosocial factors are\\ninterdependent and can influence outcomes for patient illness trajectory [2, 14, 20]. Despite\\nthe emotional toll of an acute neurological injury and subsequent Neuro-ICU admission,\\nfew studies have explored depression and anxiety as predictors of QoL trajectories among\\nboth patients and caregivers [21]. Prior research, which has focused on patients and rarely\\nthe caregivers, or on both individuals together as a dyad [22], has found that post-traumatic\\nstress in patients can negatively impact caregiver psychological symptoms and QoL [1, 23].\\nExploring the dyadic relationship through interdependence modeling can identify the effect\\nthat patients and caregivers have on their own and each other’s mental health trajectories\\n[2, 5, 23–27]. An increasing body of research has noted an interdependency between patient\\nand caregiver levels of anxiety in association with patient illness [2, 26–28]. Evidence\\nexists for dyadic patterns of interdependence for emotional distress and admission to a\\nNeuro-ICU and medical-ICU [23, 26, 28]; however, the impact that depression and anxiety\\nQuinn et al.\\nPage 2\\nInt J Behav Med. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2025 May 06.\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nhave on QoL over time in Neuro-ICU dyads remains unknown. In a previous analysis of this\\ndataset, higher patient and caregiver mindfulness and adaptive coping scores at admission\\npredicted one’s own lower 3-month anxiety symptoms, especially caregivers (i.e., actor\\neffects). Further, one’s own baseline anxiety symptom scores had a negative impact on\\none’s partner’s 3-month anxiety severity (i.e., partner effects) [2]. While this research is\\nimportant for understanding dyadic relationships between anxiety and coping, the impacts\\non long-term QoL among these patients and caregivers have not been explored. This study\\nbuilds on Meyers et al. [2] by investigating dyadic relationships between depression and\\nanxiety on quality of life to advance our knowledge of the long-term psychological impact\\nof a Neuro-ICU admission on patients and caregivers. This research gap is notable given that\\ndepression and anxiety often affect patients long after their Neuro-ICU stay [1, 9, 12, 18,\\n20]. Research that identifies early psychological risk factors, such as depression and anxiety\\nexperienced during Neuro-ICU admission, has the potential to inform treatments aimed at\\nimproving QoL and promoting resilience for both dyad members.\\nThe present study aims to identify the dyadic association between levels of depression\\nand anxiety for both patients and caregivers within 2 weeks of Neuro-ICU admission\\nwith 3-month QoL. We first hypothesize that for both patients and caregivers, one’s own\\nhigher depression and anxiety symptom scores at Neuro-ICU admission would be associated\\nwith one’s own lower QoL domain scores at 3-months post-discharge [1, 21, 26]. Second,\\nwe hypothesize that both patient’s and caregiver’s own depression and anxiety symptom\\nscores at admission will be interdependent with their partner’s lower 3-month QoL domain\\nscores, such that one’s own depression and anxiety at admission will negatively affect\\none’s partner’s long-term QoL. We discuss potential clinical implications of our findings\\nfor addressing depression and anxiety early after the Neuro-ICU, such as resiliency-based\\ninterventions [3, 9–12].\\nMethods\\nParticipants and Procedures\\nThis study is a secondary analysis of a prospective, longitudinal, observational dataset of\\npatients admitted to the Neuro-ICU and their caregivers [2, 5, 23]. This is the only study\\nfrom this dataset that investigates the dyadic relationship between anxiety and depression\\non long-term QoL among Neuro-ICU patients and caregivers. Our team has conducted a\\nseries of studies to integrate psychosocial care into Neuro-ICU settings [29] and inform the\\ndevelopment of a novel dyadic resilience intervention [30]. Our team has published other\\nanalyses with these data focused on understanding the long-term psychological impact of a\\nNeuro-ICU admission [2]. The Massachusetts General Brigham Institutional Review Board\\napproved all study procedures (2014P002793).\\nWe recruited patients admitted to the Neuro-ICU and their caregivers (dyads) within w\\nweeks of Neuro-ICU admission at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, MA, from\\n2015 to 2016. All participants were cleared for participation by the ICU medical team [1,\\n2, 5, 21, 23], and approximately 70% of all admitted patients were eligible to participate\\nin this study [2]. Patient-caregiver dyads completed all baseline measures in the Neuro-ICU\\nand 3-month outcomes post-discharge (follow-up). The majority of caregivers were parents,\\nQuinn et al.\\nPage 3\\nInt J Behav Med.

Dyads were screened at bedside for the following\\ninclusion criteria in patients: (1) 18 years of age or older, (2) literacy and English language\\nfluency, (3) admission to the Neuro-ICU within the previous 2 weeks (most patients were\\nenrolled within 2 days), and (4) communicative patients with transient aphasia or mild\\ncognitive symptoms who were cleared by the medical team for participation. Exclusion\\ncriteria for patients, determined with the attending Neuro-ICU clinical team, included (1)\\ninability to complete self-report questionnaires or make personal medical decisions due\\nto their acute neurological injury, (2) possible impending death in the Neuro-ICU, (3)\\nsymptomatic chronic aphasia or delirium, and (4) no designated or identified primary,\\ninformal caregiver [1, 5, 21]. Inclusion criteria for caregivers included (1) 18 years of age\\nor older, (2) literacy and English language fluency, and (3) primary informal caregiver as\\ndetermined by the patient.\\nFigure 1 illustrates the participant flowchart. Eligible patients and caregivers completed\\nstudy measures within 2 weeks of Neuro-ICU (baseline) and at 3-months (follow-up) post-\\ndischarge. We conducted paper assessments at bedside and contacted dyads via email (or\\nphone) at follow-up online via REDCap. REDCap is a secure, web-based application for\\ndata collection and has been used in our other Neuro-ICU studies with this population [31,\\n32]. Study staff assisted patients with completion of questionnaires as needed. For follow-up\\nassessment, study staff made three contact attempts before considering a participant as lost\\nto follow-up. Due to significant data lost to 6-month follow-up, we restricted our APIM to\\nthe baseline and 3-month follow-up data.\\nMeasures\\nDemographic Characteristics and Clinical Variables—We collected patient and\\ncaregiver demographic characteristics at admission including sex, age, race, ethnicity,\\nmarital status, level of education, employment status, and mental health history. Clinical\\nvariables were obtained from the patient’s medical records, including primary neurological\\ndiagnosis (stroke/hemorrhage, brain aneurysm, tumor, lesion/brain mass, traumatic brain\\ninjury, seizure) and intubation status (yes/no).\\nHospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)—We measured depression and\\nanxiety symptoms for both patients and caregivers within 2 weeks of Neuro-ICU admission\\n(baseline) and 3-months post-discharge (follow-up) using the Hospital Anxiety and\\nDepression Scale (HADS). The HADS is a 14-item self-report tool that measures both\\nAnxiety (7 questions) and Depression (7 questions) in the past week [33]. Items are scored\\non a Likert Scale rating of 0–3 with total scores ranging from 0 to 21. On their respective\\nsubscales, total scores of 0–6 indicate no anxiety or depression, and scores of 7 or greater\\nindicate clinically significant symptoms of anxiety or depression [1]. The HADS is both\\nvalid and reliable and has been used in other Neuro-ICU settings [3, 15].\\nQuality of Life: World Health Organization QOL‑BREF (WHOQOL‑BREF)—We\\ntested the impact on 3-month QoL for both patients and caregivers within 2 weeks\\nof Neuro-ICU admission (baseline) and 3-months post-discharge (follow-up) using the\\nWHOQOL-BREF. The WHOQOL-BREF is a 26-item self-report tool that measures QoL\\nQuinn et al.\\nPage 4\\nInt J Behav Med. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2025 May 06.\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nacross four domains: (1) the Physical domain addresses perceptions of independence in\\ndaily living, general health, energy, work capacity, sleep, and fatigue; (2) the Psychological\\ndomains addresses positive and negative emotions and feelings, self-esteem, cognitive\\nfunction, and meaning making; (3) the Social relationships domain addresses personal life\\nsatisfactions, perceptions and availability of social support, and satisfaction with sex life;\\n(4) the Environmental domain addresses physical freedom, safety, security, opportunities for\\nrecreation, and time for caregiving [21, 26, 34]. Scores for each domain are transformed,\\nwith higher scores (range = 0 to 20) indicating better QoL [28]. As an abbreviated version of\\nthe full WHOQOL-100, the WHOQOL-BREF is an easy-to-use, reliable, and valid measure\\n[16, 21].\\nStatistical Analysis Plan—We ran descriptive statistics to report demographics,\\nclinical characteristics, and study measures using IBM SPSS Statistics (version 25) [35].\\nWe examined associations between these variables at admission for both patients and\\ncaregivers using independent-sample t-tests, one-way analysis of variance, chi-square\\ntests of independence, and Pearson correlations as appropriate. Prior to hypothesis\\ntesting, we performed validity checks on the study measures, and we ran bivariate\\ncorrelations for both patients and caregivers as an exploratory analysis to inform the\\nactor-partner interdependence modeling (APIM) [24, 25]. Dyadic analysis must be treated\\nas interdependent; therefore, regression alone cannot address interdependence because it\\nfocuses solely upon the individual baseline measures as a predictor of long-term QoL [22,\\n24, 25, 27, 36].\\nWe used APIM with an online application (https://apimsem.ugent.be/shiny/apim_sem/) [24]\\nand tested the impact of patients’ and caregivers’ depression and anxiety symptoms at\\nbaseline (within 2 weeks of Neuro-ICU admission) and 3-month QoL [23]. We were not\\nable to adjust for demographics within APIM due to the relatively small sample size. APIM\\nis an accepted and popular method for measuring the impact that dyads have on one another\\nand has been used for dyadic comparisons in a Neuro-ICU [2, 5, 23, 25, 36]. In this model,\\ninterdependence addresses the relationship between a dyadic association and QoL outcomes\\ndue to patient illness [2, 23, 25, 26, 28, 36]. An “actor effect” tests for an individual’s\\nseparate baseline depression and anxiety measures predicting his/her own 3-month QoL\\n[2, 23–26]. A “partner effect” tests for a patient’s and caregiver’s baseline anxiety and\\ndepression measures predicting his/her partner’s related 3-month QoL [2, 23–26]. We\\nanalyzed QoL domains (Physical, Psychological, Social relationships, and Environmental)\\nas outcomes in separate APIM models. Given that depression and anxiety are highly co-\\nmorbid in Neuro-ICU patients and caregivers, analyzing outcomes from separate composite\\nsubscales of depression and anxiety scores from within the Hospital Anxiety and Depression\\nScale (HADS) psychometric measure can assist providers in these settings to treat symptoms\\nconcurrently [3, 14], as well as examine the unique effects of depression and anxiety.\\nOutcomes with p < 0.05 were considered significant and demonstrated an impactful\\nrelationship between an individual’s baseline measures and their partner’s 3-month QoL\\noutcomes [2, 23–25].\\nQuinn et al.\\nPage 5\\nInt J Behav Med.

This may suggest that\\nreductions in physical functioning from an acute neurological injury remained noticeable to\\npatients 3-months post-hospitalization. Patients and caregivers did not significantly differ by\\ndepression, anxiety, or QoL at baseline or 3 months.\\nBivariate Analysis of Patient and Caregiver Depression and Anxiety at Neuro‑ICU\\nAdmission with 3‑Month Quality of Life Domains\\nTable 3 presents the bivariate correlations results for patient depression and anxiety scores at\\nadmission, and their 3-month QoL (all domains).

For both patients and caregivers, no partner effects were significant for baseline\\nanxiety impacting 3-month QoL.\\nDiscussion\\nThis prospective study examined the longitudinal association between depression and\\nanxiety at Neuro-ICU admission and 3-month QoL domains (Physical, Psychological,\\nSocial relationships, and Environmental) in both patients and caregivers. By examining\\nactor and partner effects in APIM, we found that depression, not anxiety, after Neuro-\\nICU admission significantly predicted long-term QoL in patients (all QoL domains) and\\ncaregivers (psychological and social relationships). These findings are notable given the high\\nrates of emotional distress among Neuro-ICU patients and caregivers [8, 10, 11], which\\nexceed other medical cohorts without neurological injuries [6–9, 11]. Our study highlights\\nthe need to further explore the psychosocial impacts of Neuro-ICU admission on dyads’\\nlong-term health outcomes.\\nFor actor effects, patients’ baseline depression significantly affected their own 3-month\\nQoL in all domains. This significance may be due to the negative impact on a patient’s\\nlong-term psychological wellbeing (e.g., emotional distress due to brain injuries, especially\\nstroke survivors) [4, 9, 10]; physical impairment (e.g., loss of mobility and changes\\nin roles and responsibilities) [12, 19]; social relationships impairments (e.g., loss of\\nindependence, changes in communications skills, and tendency to isolate) [12, 19, 26, 31];\\nand environmental impacts (e.g., the amount of time associated with physical recovery\\nand the possible loss of work) [26]. Caregivers’ baseline depression significantly affected\\ntheir own 3-month QoL in only the psychological and social relationships domains (p <\\n0.001). In contrast to patients, depressive symptoms after Neuro-ICU admission appear\\nto negatively impact caregiver’s own long-term psychological wellbeing (e.g., emotional\\ndistress and self-image) and relationship quality (e.g., perceived loss of social supports)\\nmore than physical (e.g., mobility) or environmental QoL (e.g., perceived resources) [13, 19,\\n26]. Because depression was a significant predictor of lower long-term QoL for both dyad\\nmembers, our findings suggest that psychosocial treatments in Neuro-ICU settings should\\naddress the differential impacts of depression among patients and caregivers.\\nWith respect to partner effects, baseline depression in caregivers had a significant negative\\nassociation with patients’ 3-month QoL within the psychological and environmental\\ndomains. Caregivers’ emotional stress after Neuro-ICU can have lasting impacts on\\npatients’ long-term QoL [21, 26]. For example, increased time and burden for caregiving\\nmay negatively impact patients and their health recovery more over time [13, 18, 19].\\nCounterintuitively, we also found that patient depression was associated with higher 3-\\nQuinn et al.\\nPage 7\\nInt J Behav Med.

The most likely explanation is a false positive\\nresult (i.e., type I error) due to running multiple APIM analyses. However, it is possible\\nthat caregivers had higher self-esteem and positive attitudes, and thus higher 3-month\\npsychological QoL, after attending to patients’ baseline depressive symptoms. Regardless,\\nadditional studies are needed to better understand this relationship and explore potential\\nconfounding variables, such as social support network [13, 18, 19, 26, 27], resilience [2, 15,\\n23], mindfulness, and coping skills [2, 5].\\nThe observed toll of depressive symptoms, beyond the influence of anxiety, on both patient\\nand caregiver’s long-term QoL underscores the need to prioritize early assessment and\\ntreatment to promote dyads’ mental health in addition to their physical recovery. This\\nfinding aligns with similar research that compared elevations in depression and anxiety\\nsymptoms in both Neuro-ICU patients and caregivers in comparison to cancer patients and\\ncaregivers [14, 27], as well as mood disorders associated with neurological injuries, such\\nas strokes [26, 37]. Prior research has also shown that patients and caregivers have high\\nlevels of anxiety and related post-traumatic stress brought on by Neuro-ICU admission\\nand long-term recovery [21]. Prior research utilizing APIM for the analysis of dyadic\\ninterdependence in stem cell transplantation also supports the findings for depression\\noutweighing anxiety for long-term QoL [38]. Our findings suggest that, when examined\\nsimultaneously in dyadic models, depression is a stronger predictor of long-term QoL in\\npatients and caregivers. Criteria for depressive disorders may overlap with QoL domain\\nfacets, such as insomnia, fatigue, and mobility issues (Physical QoL); lack of or diminished\\ninterest in activities, difficulty concentrating, and psychomotor agitation (Psychological\\nand Environmental QoL); and low self-esteem and feelings of hopelessness/helplessness\\n(Social relationships QoL) [34, 37]. The combination of neurological injuries contributing to\\ndepression, and the possible alignment of depressive symptoms with QoL domains, points to\\nthe need for future research to explore a better understanding of the mechanisms that explain\\nthe prominence of depression.\\nThe results are consistent with prior research for depression in Neuro-ICU patients [6, 20,\\n21, 26–28] and expands our understanding by demonstrating the prospective relationship\\nbetween depression and QoL across four domains. Depression in Neuro-ICU patients\\nincreases the risk for a wide range of adverse outcomes, including stroke or hemorrhage\\n[9, 10, 12, 14, 23, 39], intubation, [3, 39], decreased physical mobility [19, 41], less abilities\\nfor self-care [26], and inability or delay in returning to work [6, 7, 42]. Particularly for\\nstroke patients [9, 11, 40] who were intubated [3], depression is associated with increased\\nanxiety and post-traumatic stress. After Neuro-ICU discharge, depressive symptoms such\\nas avoidant behavior [43] may contribute to a “disability spiral” of worsening Physical,\\nPsychological, Social relationships, and Environmental QoL that hinders their ability to\\nregain independence [15, 44].\\nPrevious research has shown that in caregivers of Neuro-ICU patients, higher levels of\\ndepression symptoms are associated with increased levels of emotional distress, social\\nisolation, and caregiver burden [4, 8, 13, 14, 20, 26, 44, 45]. Long-term impairments in\\nQoL and depression among caregivers may have negative “spillover effects” on their loved\\none’s recovery [15, 18, 21, 26, 28, 44] — a responsibility that should not be faced by\\nQuinn et al.\\nPage 8\\nInt J Behav Med.

Our findings suggest that for both patients and caregivers,\\nlong-term promotion of QoL may involve early identification and prevention of depression\\nand anxiety symptoms following admission.\\nThe findings from this prospective sample contribute to the mounting evidence that\\npsychosocial interventions are needed to prevent chronic emotional distress in patients and\\ncaregivers [1, 2, 5, 14, 20, 21, 23, 28]. To fill this treatment gap in Neuro-ICU settings,\\nour team has iteratively developed Recovering Together, a dyadic mindfulness-based and\\nresilience intervention [28, 31]. In an efficacy trial conducted after this prospective study,\\nRT demonstrated the feasibility and preliminary efficacy for reducing depression, anxiety,\\nand post-traumatic stress in Neuro-ICU patients and caregivers [28, 31, 46]. Such resilience\\nand mindfulness based interventions show promise for reducing depression, anxiety, and\\npsychosocial distress, as well as improving QoL in both patients and caregivers [2, 15, 21,\\n23]. Future research is needed to understand whether changes in mindfulness and other\\nresilience factors can mediate the relationship between depression and long-term QoL.\\nThis study had five key limitations. First, the subsamples were relatively small for contrast\\nand dyadic patterns testing for patients and caregivers (n = 72 each). Nevertheless,\\nour results are meaningful because neuro-ICU patients and caregivers are a challenging\\npopulation and few studies have successfully compared dyad members. Relatedly, we\\nare unable to determine whether QoL changed beyond the 3-month follow-up due to\\ndifficulty maintaining longer-term patient and caregiver participation. Future dyadic studies\\nwith larger sample sizes are needed to fully examine the role of patient and caregiver\\ndemographic variables, such as sex and age, because of the important influence that\\nthese factors have on dyadic QoL [13, 26]. Second, QoL domains were designed for the\\ngeneral population and may be as sensitive to Neuro-ICU patients, especially stroke patients\\n[19]. Third, we recruited neurologically intact patients and their caregivers only to ensure\\nvalidity of the self-reports. Excluding patients (and their caregivers) with more severe acute\\nneurological injuries may have restricted the range of depression and anxiety symptoms\\nobserved. Previous research on proxy assessments has shown that caregivers and clinicians\\ntend to rate patients’ QoL lower than how patients would assess themselves [19, 47]. Fourth,\\nthe majority of the sample, conducted at a large medical center, was white and highly\\neducated, which limits the generalizability of our findings to more diverse populations at\\ndifferent treatment settings.\\nConclusions\\nThis study explored the actor-partner effects related to higher depression and anxiety\\nsymptoms and long-term QoL from hospitalization through recovery. By examining both\\npatients and caregivers, we contributed to the growing evidence of the importance of\\nidentifying psychological symptoms on long-term QoL, especially for high-need Neuro-ICU\\ndyads. Early identification of clinically significant depression at admission can create\\nopportunities for patient and caregiver interventions throughout the Neuro-ICU stay to\\nprevent long-term detrimental effects on QoL.

       " 'Introduction\\nAs the field of neurocritical care continues to grow, patient centered outcomes need to be\\nstudied in addition to crude survival and functional outcomes. Critical care-based societies\\nhave recommended prioritizing research that encourages survivor focused outcomes.1\\nCohort studies from the Neuroscience Intensive Care Unit (NSICU) have often focused on\\nfunctional outcomes alone.2–5 Resources necessary for transitioning out of the critical care\\nsetting is a unique outcome metric that has been previously highlighted as an important\\nunmet need in general critical care.6 To understand how neurocritical care can be improved\\nfor survivors, a qualitative assessment of transition needs following discharge is necessary.\\nAlthough there have been previous studies to determine needs related to post-ICU care\\ntransitions, none have been well studied in the neurocritical care patient population.7 For\\ninstance, patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have been described\\npreviously as having many hurdles in transitioning out of the ICU, moving from a critically\\nill state into a rehabilitative state, integrating back into society, and frequently struggling\\nwith their new life outside of the ICU.8 Discharge checklists, education, and tip sheets have\\nbeen developed based on input and qualitative interviews from stroke survivors and stroke\\ncaregivers, although a limited proportion of stroke patients require the provisions of critical\\ncare.9,10\\nWe performed a quality improvement initiative to follow patients with critical neurological\\ninjuries11 using a nursing-led strategy to obtain qualitative data pertaining to 1) unmet\\nresources and 2) unanswered questions post-ICU discharge by asking open-ended questions.\\nWe hypothesized that by using established thematic content analysis techniques, we would\\nfind areas that may be targets for improvement in the discharge and care-transition\\nprocesses.\\nRath et al.\\nPage 2\\nJ Neurosci Nurs. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2021 August 01.\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nMethods\\nThis was a quality improvement initiative to understand post-discharge outcomes and\\nqualitative unmet needs and concerns of critically ill patients or their informal caregivers\\nadmitted to the neuroscience intensive care unit (NSICU) at the University of Cincinnati,\\nwhich is a Level 1 trauma center, comprehensive stroke center, and quaternary referral\\ncenter. Our retrospective reporting of these data were approved by the Institutional Review\\nBoard (IRB) of the University of Cincinnati with waiver of informed consent. Data\\ncollection for this project has been previously described.11 Once neurocritically ill survivors\\nwere identified and verified, we performed a scripted telephone assessment between 3–6\\nmonths following admission. Data was entered using REDCap (Research Electronic Data\\nCapture), a secure, web-based application.12 We preferentially requested to speak to the\\npatient, but then asked if the primary caregiver would answer on the patients’ behalf if the\\npatient was not able to speak. We did not query if the caregiver was a care partner, although\\nit is possible some of the participants may have had formalized care partner relationships.\\nPatients or caregivers were specifically asked 1) if they had adequate resources upon\\ndischarge and 2) if they had any unanswered questions or comments. If they answered these\\nopen-ended questions, they were encouraged to expand on their responses.\\nQualitative responses were analyzed using thematic content analysis, using inductive and\\ndeductive coding to identify, analyze, and report overarching patterns (themes) and nuanced\\npatterns (codes) across a dataset. Two researchers (NK and KR) independently coded the\\nresponses, then met weekly to work through each transcript together. A directed content\\nanalysis approach was used to interpret the transcribed data.13\\nA codebook for each of the two questions was developed collaboratively through discussions\\namong our research team to ensure consistent application of codes. For each code, we\\nincluded a long definition, short definition, when to use, when not to use, and an example of\\neach code. The code books were agreed on by all team members prior to coding, and\\ninductive changes were made by NK and KR during the formal coding period. When\\nchanges to the code book were made, the coders reviewed previously coded interviews with\\nthe revised code book to make certain that no previously coded segments were mislabeled.\\nThe abbreviated code books are included as Tables 1 and 2.\\nBoth coders generated new emergent codes as needed, and later compared and discussed\\nuntil consensus in coding styles was reached. If the two coders were unable to reach\\nagreement, a third-party adjudicator was used (BF). Throughout the process of coding,\\nemergent patterns, themes, and noteworthy statements were documented, as a way to\\nprovide analytical depth, identify illustrative quotes, and highlight points for further\\ndiscussion. The proportion of themes for each major neurocritical care diagnosis, length of\\nstay, and discharge destination were examined.\\nRath et al.\\nPage 3\\nJ Neurosci Nurs.

Of those, a total of 365/1324 (27.6%) died in\\nthe hospital whereas another 150 died after discharge for a follow-up mortality of 515/1324\\n(38.9%). Of 959 hospital survivors, 557 were reached by the study team at 4.4 +/− 0.8\\nmonths after their initial admission. 232 provided a qualitative response to open ended\\nquestions. Demographics of those who provided qualitative responses were compared to\\nthose who did not (see Table, Supplemental Digital Content 4). The two groups were similar\\nin proportions of race, primary diagnosis, hospital length of stay, discharge destination, and\\nwhether the responses were from the survivor or a caregiver. The two groups were\\nsignificantly different in that male patients or caregivers of male patients were more likely\\nthan female patients or caregivers of female patients to provide a qualitative response, and\\npatients with an ICU stay of <72 hours were less likely to provide a qualitative response\\ncompared to those with an ICU stay of >72 hours.\\nQualitative Analysis:\\nResources at discharge—Comments regarding patient resources at discharge fell into\\nfive major themes: 1) satisfied 2) it was okay, but something happened that could be\\nimproved 3) dissatisfied with ICU and discharge 4) post-ICU care was bad 4) and ongoing\\nhealth concerns. Each of the themes contained more specific, targetable codes. There was\\n94.7% agreement for codes in patient resources at discharge. The most commonly described\\ntheme for patient resources at discharge was, “It was okay.” This theme broadly described\\ncaregiver responses that pointed out specific areas upon discharge where their needs were\\nnot met. This included several codes such as patients reporting no home care, no\\nappointment, unclear discharge instructions, or insurance issues. The most commonly coded\\nunmet need overall for discharge was premature discharge (n = 12). Additional commonly\\ncoded responses to the open-ended question about resources upon discharge were unclear\\ndischarge (n = 11), poorly prepared (n = 9), and ghosted (n = 9).\\nThe most commonly coded theme regarding resources at discharge (based on percent of total\\ncodes within each diagnosis) for all major diagnoses is included in Supplemental Digital\\nContent 2. Individuals who were admitted for a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) or\\nseizures/status epilepticus reported poorer ICU discharge processes when compared to other\\nmajor diagnoses. Additionally, only individuals with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) reported\\nany satisfaction with the discharge process. Patients with an ICU LOS >72 hours had a\\nhigher proportion of responses reporting a poor discharge process, less satisfaction, and poor\\npost-ICU care compared to those in the ICU < 72 hours. Patients who were discharged from\\nthe hospital to a skilled nursing facility (SNF) were most likely to report poor post-ICU care,\\nand those who were discharged to inpatient rehabilitation were least likely to report poor\\npost-ICU care (Supplemental Digital Content 5).\\nUnanswered Questions—Unanswered questions or comments after discharge fell into\\nsix themes, 1) neutral 2) positive, 3) negative, 4) medical questions, 5) ongoing medical\\nRath et al.\\nPage 4\\nJ Neurosci Nurs. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2021 August 01.\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nconcern or questions, or 6) remembrance. There was 99% agreement in coding the\\nunanswered questions or comments. Within these themes, several common codes emerged.\\nThe most common codes for unanswered questions after discharge were in the theme title,\\n“positive care,” which included Good care in the ICU (115), Enthusiasm for institution (33),\\nand Grateful (31). The most common theme in response to unanswered questions (based on\\npercent of total codes that occurred for each diagnosis) for each major diagnosis is listed in\\nSupplemental Digital Content 3. Commonly coded responses within the theme of “areas of\\nimprovement” were bad post-ICU care (n = 15), lacking follow up (n = 15), recovery needs\\n(n = 15), disease complication (n = 14), and got info (n = 14).\\nIndividuals with TBI reported much fewer positive responses compared to other diagnoses,\\nwith only 5% of responses positive, compared to the next lowest, which was 39%. Patients\\ndischarged home had the highest proportion of positive comments about their ICU stay.\\nDiscussion\\nOur study is the first to describe the neurocritical care discharge process. The use of open-\\nended post-ICU assessments such as this can inform iterative changes in practice that can be\\nevaluated based on changes in the perception of needs with the potential to provide evidence\\nfor practices such as discharge education that are untestable via traditional clinical trial\\ndesign.14 Our findings suggest that there are many unmet needs and concerns related to\\ntransition out of the ICU in a complicated neurocritically ill patient population for which we\\ncan develop further improvements in care.\\nThe most common unmet need regarding resources after discharge was that caregivers\\nperceived their loved one was prematurely discharged, or they felt unprepared to leave the\\nICU with their loved one. Patients who are medically not prepared for ICU discharge do\\nhave worse outcomes, but the perception that a loved one was prematurely discharged has\\nnot been associated with worse outcomes.15 It is likely that the sense of being prematurely\\ndischarged may be felt by caregivers of loved ones who received little information,\\neducation, or follow-up regarding the next phases of care after the ICU. It is also possible\\nthat during the time in ICU, patients and/or caregivers had difficulty receiving information\\ndue to low health literacy, cognitive or memory distortions due to stress or illness, or they\\nwere simply overwhelmed at the time. Patients and caregivers reported that home health\\nservices were challenging to obtain, and were expecting services beyond the scope of home\\nhealth care, which is consistent with previous qualitative studies of discharged hospital\\npatients.16 This may have contributed to the sense of premature discharge. Many patients\\nand caregivers also spoke subjectively about how long it had taken them to recover, and that\\nthey were surprised by the amount of time they experienced residual neurologic deficits.\\nAlthough this is consistent with published timelines of neuro-recovery, additional education\\nat the time of discharge may have allowed patients and caregivers to develop a framework\\nfor the timing of recovery, and may have decreased the number who reported the perception\\nof a premature discharge.17\\nWe targeted the use of qualitative methods to study discharge unmet needs and concerns, as\\nno other quantitative measure would be specific enough to obtain this information. One\\nRath et al.\\nPage 5\\nJ Neurosci Nurs. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2021 August 01.\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nsimilar prior systematic review of four qualitative studies of pediatric intensive care unit\\ntransitions has been published, describing that the period of ICU discharge was emotionally,\\nphysically, and socially challenging, with the perception of little targeted support for\\nfamilies during this vulnerable time.18 Future studies should seek to develop comprehensive\\ndischarge processes from the neuro ICU that incorporate family support and education.\\nWe found that patients with a longer ICU stay (> 72 hours) had a higher proportion of\\nresponses that indicated a poor discharge process, and more frequently reported poor post\\nICU care, compared to those with a shorter ICU stay (<72 hours). Although this study was\\nnot designed to determine the reasons for this finding, it is likely that patients with a longer\\nICU stay are more medically complex, and require additional services and preparation prior\\nto ICU discharge. Further, patients who were discharged to a SNF were more likely to report\\npoor post-ICU care compared to other discharge destinations. Previously published\\nevidence, however, has reported that satisfaction with SNF placement can be improved if\\npatients and families are both educated and involved in the decision about location, type, and\\nmobility goals of a skilled nursing facility stay.19–21\\nIndividuals with TBI reported the lowest levels of positive responses when asked about any\\nconcerns. While this study is unable to make inferences for why this was the case, many\\nrespondents with TBI described complex, hectic discharges with numerous specialists and\\nancillary providers necessary for their post-ICU care. However, some unmet needs were\\ncommon in all groups of patients, such as financial counseling, neuro-recovery education, or\\nincreased access to home health services, and could be addressed within the larger\\nneurocritical care cohort to streamline options for patients and caregivers in these realms.\\nLimitations:\\nOur study was limited in that it was a quality improvement initiative rather than a formal\\nclinical observational cohort study. While one of the authors performed the majority of the\\ndata entry and quality (ELS) and another the majority of the phone call follow-up (OL),\\ndifferent personnel participated over time which may have altered the qualitative responses\\nfrom caregivers and their willingness to speak with study personnel. There is risk of bias, as\\nsome patients/caregivers chose to not provide qualitative responses. However, those who did\\nprovide qualitative responses did not have significant demographic differences, other than\\ngender, compared to those who did not provide responses. Our analysis only used patients\\nwithin a single institution, so other institutions with differing discharge processes may have\\nother findings. We used telephone contact as our method for follow up and qualitative\\nassessments. Qualitative assessments may have been different if obtained in person. Also,\\nour qualitative information was obtained 3–6 months after the hospitalization. While this\\nallowed patients or caregivers to place their ICU discharge in perspective, it may have led to\\nresponses that were subject to recall bias due to the length of time that had passed, the\\nneurologic injury itself, or post-traumatic stress.\\nRath et al.\\nPage 6\\nJ Neurosci Nurs.

A neurocritical care\\nintervention that entails a streamlined ICU discharge process that would ensure follow-up,\\nprovide education on post ICU care, and include a specific number to call in the event of\\nquestions may reduce problems that were brought up in this study. This intervention would\\nprovide a meaningful way for nurses to contribute to patient/caregiver wellness after a\\nneurocritical illness, as well as provide a smoother transition from the ICU setting to the\\nrehabilitation and outpatient settings. Although ICU discharge needs were apparent in all\\ntypes of neurocritically ill patients, those who required a higher level of care after discharge\\nor had a longer ICU stay reported more dissatisfaction with post-ICU care and the ICU\\ndischarge process, and may represent a population who would benefit from a tailored\\nintervention to address discharge needs. In instances where the patient was not able to speak,\\ncaregivers provided valuable insight, and should be involved in future qualitative\\nassessments of discharge processes.',\n",
       " 'Introduction\\nThe ﬁeld of critical care rapidly expanded starting in the\\n1950s, with advancing life support that reduced\\nmortality for previously fatal organ dysfunction1;\\nhowever, research into the long-term consequences of\\nsurviving these extremes of physiology did not begin in\\nearnest until the 1990s.2,3 Since then, a large body of\\nevidence has documented the impairments, disabilities,\\nsymptom burden, and health care costs associated with\\nICU survivorship, which can last for years.4,5 In 2012,\\nthe term post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) was ﬁrst\\ndescribed to facilitate communication and research into\\nimpairments following critical illness—originally\\ncategorized into physical, cognitive, and mental health-\\nrelated domains.6 Despite a quarter century of\\nimprovement in our understanding of the epidemiology\\nof PICS, there is still poor awareness of the problem and\\ninfrequent communication between the medical team\\nand patients.7,8\\nIncidence\\nAlthough the incidence of PICS varies based on patient\\npopulation, data from cohort studies suggest that it is\\ncommon, occurring in up to 1 of every 2 ICU patients\\nwho survive to discharge. An analysis of 406 ICU\\nsurvivors (median age, 61 years) found that only\\n44% were considered “PICS-free” at 12 months. At\\n3 months, 38% had cognitive impairment, 26% had\\nphysical disabilities with new limitations in activities of\\ndaily living, and 33% experienced symptoms of\\ndepression.9 A questionnaire-based study analyzed by\\nICU admission type showed the incidence of PICS at 1\\nyear to be 43% for elective surgery requiring ICU\\nadmission, 58% for medical ICU admission, and 64% for\\nurgent surgical ICU admission.10 Additionally, the term\\nPICS-Family describes the wide-ranging and often\\nunderrecognized effects that an ICU admission can have\\non a patient’s caregivers and family. These include\\nmental health problems such as anxiety, depression, and\\nPTSD at rates similar to or exceeding those of the ICU\\nsurvivor.11,12\\nRecovery Trajectories and Risk Factors\\nUnderstanding a patient’s clinical and functional status\\nbefore the ICU, including baseline frailty, disabilities,\\ncomorbidities, and age, is paramount in understanding\\nthe most probable trajectory of recovery.13,14 One study\\nof 109 patients with ARDS with a median age of 44 years\\nand few preexisting comorbidities found an 85% survival\\nrate out to 2 years among those who survived to hospital\\ndischarge, with most returning to work and essentially\\nall returning to independent living.15 In contrast, a\\ncohort of 303 medical-surgical adult patients (median\\nage of 62 years), who predominantly lived independently\\nat home without preexisting physical or cognitive\\nimpairments, found that 43% had died within 6 months,\\nand of the survivors less than one-third returned to their\\nreported baseline functional status.16 At the upper end\\nof age and frailty, Ferrante and colleagues17 described a\\nlarge prospective community cohort assessed\\nlongitudinally for over a decade. Within this cohort, 291\\nadult patients (median age, 84 years) were admitted to\\nan ICU and were categorized into 3 pre-ICU functional\\ntrajectories: minimal disability, mild to moderate\\ndisability, and severe disability. Both mortality and post-\\nICU functional status were worse with increasing pre-\\nICU level of disability. Overall, more than one-half\\nchestjournal.org\\n925\\nexperienced functional decline or early death. Finally, an\\nobservational study of over 1,500 ICU survivors\\nemphasized this point further; among baseline\\ncharacteristics, the strongest predictors for death within\\n1 year of ICU discharge were age, comorbidities, and\\nloss of autonomy (ie, complete activities of daily living\\ndisability) at time of ICU admission.18\\nSeverity of illness and complications during an ICU stay\\nalso play a major role in long-term trajectories. Delirium\\nduration is 1 of the strongest independent predictors of\\ncognitive impairment and disability after discharge,19,20\\nemphasizing the need to prevent, monitor, and treat\\ndelirium to improve long-term outcomes. Length of\\nmechanical ventilation, shock, and ICU length of stay\\n(LOS) are also risk factors for decline in post-ICU\\nfunctional status (Fig 1).17,21\\nDespite these known risk factors, few prediction models\\nhave been developed and validated. A recent systematic\\nreview found only 3 PICS-related prediction models.22\\nSince then, a model to predict the occurrence of PICS\\nwas developed and validated in a broad ICU cohort.23,24\\nGiven providers’ low accuracy in predicting functional\\noutcomes after the ICU,8 continued efforts at developing\\nand implementing these models are necessary to help us\\nadvance our prognostication and communication to\\npatients and families.\\nCommunication and Empathy in the ICU\\nCommunication is a cornerstone of providing high-\\nquality medical care, yet it has been recognized in both\\ninpatient and outpatient medicine that physicians do not\\nroutinely discuss the long-term implications of serious\\nillnesses.25 For example, more than one-half of patients\\nwith metastatic lung or colorectal cancer were unaware\\nthat chemotherapy would be unlikely to cure their\\ndisease.26 Although discussion of functional outcomes is\\noften part of meetings between ICU providers and\\nfamilies,27 discordance in prognostic understanding is\\nrife.28,29 Highlighting this fact, Cox and colleagues30\\nfound that among 126 recipients of prolonged\\nmechanical ventilation followed over 1 year, 83% of\\nsurrogates expected a good quality of life, whereas only\\n4% of physicians expected the same.30 Barriers to\\nimproving these pivotal conversations have been\\nidentiﬁed to include unrealistic surrogate optimism\\nabout recovery expectations, a lack of contact between\\nintensivists and patients after discharge, and minimal\\nconﬁdence from intensivists in applying existing\\noutcomes research to individual patients.31\\nAlthough evidence regarding best medical\\ncommunication strategy is mixed,32 guidelines agree\\nshared decision-making should start with information\\nexchange and take into account the patient’s values and\\npreferences.33 These values and preferences must be\\nindividualized, but qualitative data have suggested key\\nthemes that focus on avoiding functional impairments.\\nIn questionnaires of over 200 seriously ill outpatients,\\nfewer participants reported they would choose\\ntreatments expected to result in physical or cognitive\\nimpairment than treatments that could result in death.34\\nAuriemma and colleagues35 likewise found in interviews\\nwith ICU survivors or surrogates that survival alone was\\ninadequate as a goal. One-half focused on also\\nmaintaining physical or cognitive function as a\\nmeaningful outcome, with severe disability in these\\ncategories being considered a fate worse than death.35\\nThese studies eloquently highlight what might be\\nintuitive to many of us, that patients are humans who\\nwant to feel they have “a life worth living.”\\nThe topic of communicating recovery from critical\\nillness would be incomplete without discussion about\\nthe importance of provider empathy. Sympathy is\\nwhen we feel “for” someone; empathy is when we feel\\n“with” someone. It can have beneﬁts of patient\\nsatisfaction, improved communication with and\\nacknowledgment of the individual patient, but also a\\ndegree of risk from “compassion fatigue.”36 Empathy\\nin the ICU is a multifaceted concept and should\\ninclude components of understanding a patient’s\\ncondition, sensing what matters most to them, and\\nCognitive\\nPhysical\\nMental\\nHealth\\nPre-ICU Status\\nIn-Hospital Factors\\nRisk of PICS\\nAge\\nComorbidities\\nFrailty\\nPre-ICU Trajectory\\nHearing or Vision Impairment\\nDelirium\\nMechanical Ventilation\\nShock\\nSepsis\\nImmobilization\\nFigure 1 – Major risk factors associated with development of PICS.\\nPICS ¼ post-intensive care syndrome.\\n926\\nHow I Do It\\n[ 1 6 8 # 4 C H E S T O C T O B E R 2 0 2 5 ]\\nproviding both support and communication (Fig 2).36\\nThe ﬁrst section of this article offers readers the\\nunderstanding that patients’ recovery outcomes are\\ninﬂuenced by their pre-ICU status and known risk\\nfactors. We then must genuinely inquire why the\\nrecovery matters to the patient. Is she an avid\\ngardener, in which case meaningful recovery must\\ninclude getting her hands in soil again? Is he a\\ngrandfather who ﬁnds joy in spending time with his\\ngrandchildren? What degree of recovery will be\\nrequired to engage with them at a level he judges as\\nmeaningful? A willingness to have conversations\\nabout a meaningful life outside of the ICU provides a\\ncommon goal for discussions on recovery. The third\\ncomponent, providing support and communication, is\\ndiscussed next.\\nHow I Do It\\nAs represented in our case examples, many patients\\nreceive inadequate preparation and discussion about\\ncommon sequelae of critical illness. We pride ourselves\\non “saving lives,” yet too often we stumble at the ﬁnish\\nline by leaving patients to discover for themselves the\\nlingering effects of critical illness. Here we introduce a\\nframework of how to improve this crucial component of\\nICU care, using an empathy-focused mindset\\nincorporating prevention, awareness, preparation, and\\nsupport (Fig 3).\\nThe initial phase of a patient’s ICU course often includes\\ncritical stabilization and life-sustaining therapies. At that\\ntime, survival is often uncertain. Nevertheless, families\\nare usually hopeful and want to know what steps we can\\ntake to improve the likelihood of survival and reduce the\\nrisk of long-term impairments. The ABCDEF bundle\\n(aka, A2F bundle; Fig 4) is an evidence-based set of 6\\nsteps that aim toward an “awake and walking” ICU\\nculture.37 The A2F bundle is a way to bring a humanistic\\napproach to ICU care with the backing of rigorous\\nscientiﬁc evidence.37-39 Higher compliance with the A2F\\nbundle’s 6 steps has been shown to reduce delirium, ICU\\nLOS, mortality, and ICU readmissions in a dose-\\ndependent manner.38,39 By decreasing delirium and ICU\\nLOS, 2 variables mentioned as risk factors for PICS and\\nworse functional trajectory following critical illness, we\\nsee this as a key component to decreasing the burden of\\nPICS. Communicating the A2F bundle to families\\ndemonstrates that we are diligently providing holistic\\ncare and allows us to encourage their bedside\\nparticipation. Higher family engagement during the\\nCOVID-19 pandemic decreased risk of delirium,40 and\\nfamilies should be aware of both the measurable and\\nunmeasurable beneﬁts of being at bedside when able.\\nFor those patients in the ICU who survive their initial\\ncritical illness and have increasing likelihood of hospital\\nsurvival, we begin to counsel patients and families on the\\nrecovery that lay ahead. Here, plain language and\\nawareness of both health literacy and cultural differences\\nis key in effective communication.41 We share that many\\nICU survivors face impairments or challenges after the\\nhospital. We personalize these conversations to show\\nUnderstanding\\nthe patient’s\\nmedical condition\\nSensing what\\nmatters most to\\nthe patient\\nProviding communication\\nand support to the\\npatient and family\\nFigure 2 – Components of empathy in ICU\\ncommunication.\\nchestjournal.org\\n927\\nempathy for the individual and an eye toward\\nsurvivorship:\\nI’m so glad that your father has improved from his\\ncritical illness. We’re hopeful that he’ll continue pro-\\ngressing towards leaving the ICU, but it’s important to be\\naware he might not immediately be capable of playing\\nbridge or pickleball again because of the concentration\\nand mobility problems many patients face after the ICU.\\nWe’ve been diligent about keeping him awake and\\nwalking daily to help him keep his muscles and brain as\\nstrong as possible so he’ll have less of these challenges.\\nWe include similar language in any major update to the\\nfamily. As ICU discharge draws closer, we introduce\\nmore details while taking care to avoid jargon or\\noverburdening the family. We review the various\\ndomains of PICS and emphasize that, although severity\\nvaries, these problems can occur in up to one-half of\\nICU survivors so that we normalize any impairments\\nthat may occur. We help prepare families by using the\\nrisk factors above to give qualitative assessments of\\npossible recovery trajectories and take into consideration\\nthe patient’s initial characteristics—age, frailty, recent\\nfunctional trajectory, and comorbidities—and in-\\nhospital risk factors of delirium, sepsis, shock,\\nmechanical ventilation and ICU LOS (Fig 1). We also\\nemphasize that not every patient experiences PICS,9 and\\nPICS-related symptoms can improve over months and\\nyears, admitting to the uncertainty inherent to\\npredicting how any individual may recover.42,43 PICS\\naffects more than patients, and we share with caregivers\\nAssess, Prevent\\nand Manage Pain\\nA\\nB\\nC\\nE\\nD\\nF\\nBoth SAT\\nand SBT\\nDelirium: Assess,\\nPrevent and Manage\\nFamily Engagement\\nand Empowerment\\nChoice of Analgesia\\nand Sedation\\nEarly Mobility\\nand Exercise\\nFigure 4 – A2F bundle framework.

We then introduce PICS so that patients and\\nfamilies are aware of the domains. We emphasize the need to prepare for these possible impairments\\nbefore ICU discharge. Finally, we refer to an ICU Recovery Clinic so that we can continue to support\\npatients and families, and re-iterate the previous two steps.\\nFigure 3 – Timeline of communication PICS to patients and families. A2F bundle ¼ ABCDEF bundle; PICS ¼ post-intensive care syndrome.\\n928\\nHow I Do It\\n[ 1 6 8 # 4 C H E S T O C T O B E R 2 0 2 5 ]\\nthat they too may experience mental health difﬁculties\\nand ﬁnancial strain in primary caregiver roles.12 Before\\ndischarge, we discuss with patients and families the\\nimportance of post-hospital follow-up to address PICS\\nand other challenges during the recovery period. We\\ngive anticipatory guidance to ease the transition of\\nleaving the hospital and to help align expectations for\\nwhat might be a new quality of life.44\\nDespite even the best attempts at these practices,\\npatients and families often still leave the hospital with\\nquestions on medications, insurance, referrals, and\\nmore. ICU recovery clinics are multidisciplinary care\\nteams that can emphasize all the prior points in the\\noutpatient setting, where patients have had time to begin\\nrecovery. These clinics improve an ICU survivor’s\\nreported quality of life and potentially decrease re-\\nadmissions by addressing the aforementioned problems,\\nas well as providing access to peer support and palliative\\ncare.45-49 The multidisciplinary approach includes a\\npharmacist, psychologist, case manager, and ICU\\nphysician. Medications are reviewed and changes usually\\nrequired, screening tools for PICS are performed, and\\nreferrals are placed when indicated. When a recovery\\nclinic is not available, primary care providers must\\novercome barriers to caring for the complexities of a\\npost-ICU patient50; we ﬁnd that the awareness and\\npreparation communicated to patients and families in\\nthe ICU can help but does not lessen the need for further\\nresearch in improving recovery in the post-ICU period.\\nApplying Our Framework\\nCase 1\\n(A young, previously healthy woman who survived\\nARDS but suffers PTSD and cognitive impairment): Ms.\\nSmith, I can only imagine what you’ve been through these\\nlast 2 weeks. You were on the ventilator to support failing\\nlungs. I’m so glad you’re getting better, but it’s important\\nto remember that there is still a long road to full recovery\\nahead. Often it takes the body and brain longer to get well\\nthan it takes them to get sick. However, most people who\\ncome into the ICU at your young age, and in such\\nprevious good state of health, will return to close to their\\nbaseline or even back to baseline. Remember, though, that\\na large fraction will have impairments over the ﬁrst\\nseveral months, and some of these could even last longer.\\nFor you, that might mean difﬁculty immediately\\nreturning to your job as a computer programmer or\\nremembering the details needed to manage your\\nhousehold with 2 kids. As an ICU survivor, you may\\ndevelop mental health problems from the suffering you\\nwent through. We did our best to lower your risk of\\ndeveloping these problems by minimizing sedation and\\nkeeping you mobile. This is a lot to take in after what\\nyou’ve been through, and our ICU recovery clinic would\\nbe happy to see you after discharge. They can screen for\\nthese problems and provide available resources. You’re\\nnot alone in your recovery.\\nCase 2\\n(Older man with biliary septic shock who developed an\\naccelerated dementia and mobility problems [Discussing\\nwith family because patient is still delirious]): We know\\nthat your father has had a very challenging last 2 weeks in\\nthe ICU. He required immense life support and as you\\ncan see is still recovering. You mentioned that before the\\nICU he was sharp, witty, and could do most daily tasks by\\nhimself. We certainly hope he makes a speedy recovery\\nhome to care for his dogs who he loves taking for daily\\nwalks, but we know that patients his age will typically\\nrequire more assistance after the ICU than before. This\\nmight mean trouble with performing his favorite\\ncrossword puzzles or remembering names of\\ngrandchildren. These symptoms can have an impact on\\nhis quality of life. We did our best to minimize the risk of\\nthese impairments with the “bundle of care” we discussed\\neach day on rounds. With the amount of delirium he\\nsuffered, it’s still very likely that he’ll have some degree of\\nproblems with his memory, concentration, and decision-\\nmaking for some time. Continuing with his physical and\\noccupational rehabilitation will likely speed his recovery.\\nIt is worth you being aware and prepared that he will\\nlikely need more help around the house and with things\\nlike ﬁnances or medications for several months and\\nperhaps even years to come. Our ICU recovery clinic can\\nprovide testing to evaluate any of the residual\\nconsequences of his critical illness, and referrals for\\nneeded medical or social work services. He is not alone in\\nhis recovery. Let’s also remember that you as a family\\nhave been a part of his suffering, and families experience\\nchallenges with mental health struggles just as often as\\npatients. Our recovery clinic has a support group for\\ncaregivers like yourself.\\nConclusion\\nCommunicating PICS to patients and families is\\nparamount in easing the often difﬁcult transition that\\ncan occur for individuals who survive the ICU.

       " 'S70 CLEVELAND CLINIC JOURNAL OF MEDICINE VOLUME 76 • SUPPLEMENT 2 APRIL 2009\\nABSTRACT\\nQ\\nEmory University Hospital recently converted its\\nneurocritical care unit into an environment that\\nenhances involvement of the patient’s family. Each\\npatient room now has an adjacent family area with\\ncomfortable accommodations for daytime and\\nnighttime use. The new unit design, which drew from\\nevidence on the impact of the physical environment\\non patient outcomes, facilitates better interactions\\nbetween families and the medical team, and early\\nstudies show that patient satisfaction and staff\\nsatisfaction have increased. This article describes the\\nimpetus for and process of the unit redesign, as well\\nas initial results and lessons learned.\\nA\\nlthough my medical training prepared me\\nwell for treating brain injuries, I learned\\nvery little about caring for the enormous\\nemotional needs of patients in neurocriti-\\ncal care units and their families. Having a physical\\nenvironment that encourages the participation of the\\npatient’s family is extremely important. Not only can\\nhaving loved ones nearby give great comfort to the\\npatient, but it helps provide a critically ill patient\\nwith an identity, which affects quality of care in fun-\\ndamental ways. Having an identity is an anchor for\\neverything, ultimately infl uencing not only clinical\\ncare but research as well.\\nThis article describes our experience in develop-\\ning a new neurocritical care environment at Emory\\nUniversity Hospital over the last 10 years using an\\nevidence-based design centered on caring for patients\\nand their families.\\nQ STARTING POINT:\\nA RAPIDLY GROWING PATIENT POPULATION\\nEmory University Hospital, part of the Emory Health-\\ncare health system, is the largest medical center in\\nGeorgia, with 43 neuroscience fl oor beds, 27 dedi-\\ncated neurocritical care beds, and 10 intermediate\\nneurocritical care beds. We have experienced rapid\\ngrowth, with neurocritical care admissions rising from\\n587 in 1999 to more than 1,400 in 2007. We treat\\npatients with meningitis, brain aneurysms, tumors,\\nmassive strokes, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthe-\\nnia gravis, and other severe problems.\\nWhen we proposed building a replacement neuro-\\ncritical care unit, we fi rst appealed to the bottom line:\\nif we had more beds and could attract more patients, we\\nwould generate more revenue. The hospital’s mission\\nstated that we had to take care of patients with neuro-\\nlogical emergencies because no one else in town could.\\nThe administration countered with predictable\\nrestrictions: because Emory University was at that\\ntime considering building an expensive replacement\\nhospital, they did not want to spend a lot of money\\nimproving a single unit. They agreed only to meet\\nthe state and federal requirements so that we could\\nquickly open up and receive additional patients.\\nThe initial design was for a 24-bed intensive care\\nunit (ICU) with a “track” around it: visitors would\\nenter patient rooms from the back so as not to disrupt\\nthe central area used by the doctors and nurses. The\\nrooms measured 200 square feet, as required by the\\nstate of Georgia, with no dedicated space for family\\nmembers. This design actually duplicated the system\\nwe already had in many ways.\\nQ TRADITIONAL SYSTEM: PATIENTS SURROUNDED\\nBY EQUIPMENT, NOT FAMILY\\nIn our old unit, the typical patient room was so\\ncrowded with specialized equipment that it was virtu-\\nally impossible to get to the patient without tripping\\nover cords and knocking out catheters.

During rounds, residents, fellows, and the mul-\\ntidisciplinary team practically fell over one another,\\nand actually seeing the patient in the midst of all\\nthis was a challenge. In the central area, nurses were\\ncrowded around desks with charts spread all over\\ntables, increasing the potential for mistakes in record-\\nkeeping and medications.\\nWhere were the families? We previously had a dark,\\ndingy common space in the outside hallway, well away\\nfrom patients. Families were prohibited from being\\nin patient rooms during rounds for fear they should\\nmisinterpret or be alarmed by something they heard.\\nDiscussions between doctors and families took place\\neither in the cluttered patient room or in a public\\narea. Imagine this in situations in which a patient’s\\nprognosis was poor and discussion was needed regard-\\ning brain death and organ donation. The new space\\npromised little more than some new converter chair/\\nbeds in the common areas.\\nI did not have a clear idea of exactly what we needed,\\nbut I knew that the proposed design was not it.\\nEVIDENCE FOR A BETTER WAY\\nQ\\nTo convince the administration that we should pursue\\na completely new concept, we focused on key people:\\nthe chief executive offi cer of Emory Healthcare and\\nthe chief nursing offi cer of the neurosciences critical\\ncare unit. We told them that the current ICU was\\nterrible for families and was inherently dangerous.\\nThe potential for medical mistakes was enormous and\\nprobably largely unrecognized. Staff burnout was also\\na potential issue: we reminded them of the tremen-\\ndous nursing turnover, especially with our aging nurs-\\ning population. We also told them that we believed\\nthere was a better way.\\nThe medical community bases clinical decisions,\\nsuch as choosing a drug to treat infection, on evi-\\ndence from the literature. Shouldn’t such evidence\\nalso inform how we design hospitals and ICUs? I rap-\\nidly learned that convincing scientifi c evidence exists\\nthat the physical environment affects outcome.1 The\\nliterature shows that we can empower families and\\nstaff and signifi cantly reduce cost.\\nWe proposed a new design founded on an evidence-\\nbased approach for patient- and family-centered care.\\nWe were confi dent that a better design could reduce\\nstaff stress and enhance performance, and we hoped it\\ncould also reduce costs and improve effectiveness. As\\nan academic institution, we wanted to measure such\\nfactors and continue to study this issue by building\\na living laboratory of a new type of family-centered\\nICU. We also wanted every treatment tool available\\nwhile remaining fl exible enough that we could con-\\ntinue to change in the future. Most importantly, we\\nwanted to keep patients the center of our focus.\\nEMPHASIS ON FAMILY INVOLVEMENT\\nQ\\nWe sometimes fool ourselves into thinking that tech-\\nnology improves outcomes when, in fact, many other\\nfactors may be more benefi cial. When we designed\\nthe ICU we had several goals or “design drivers” in\\nmind, with accompanying measurable outcomes to be\\ntracked (Table 1).\\nOur primary driver was support for families. We\\nproposed completely eliminating all the signs restrict-\\ning visitors to the ICU, such as those reading, “No\\nvisiting: Physician rounds in progress” (we were\\ntempted to rewrite that sign as, “Physician rounds in\\nprogress: Visitor presence mandatory”). Rarely is the\\nfamily actually required to participate in the care of\\na patient; we have no contract with the family delin-\\neating what the health care system provides and what\\nwe expect the family to do.\\nWe planned for a family zone in the patient room,\\na children’s room, lockers and showers, and a fam-\\nily quiet room. Outcome measures would be patient/\\nfamily satisfaction and provider satisfaction based on\\nsurveys, as well as the number of patient/family com-\\nplaints and the number of litigation fi lings.\\nOther important drivers were the desire to support\\nmore procedures at the bedside, reduce infection,\\nreduce medical errors, and increase patient safety.\\nEvery goal had measurable outcomes to be tracked.\\nDESIGN PROCESS WAS DYNAMIC\\nQ\\nTo help determine factors such as patient room\\nsize and confi guration as well as the design of fam-\\nily spaces, we analyzed best practices of the prior 10\\nyears’ winners of the ICU Design Citation Award,\\nwhich is given jointly by the Society of Critical Care\\nMedicine, the American Association of Critical Care\\nNurses, and the American Institute of Architects\\nAcademy on Architecture for Health. We partnered\\nwith the division of health care design at Georgia\\nInstitute of Technology’s College of Architecture as\\nwell as with a psychologist specializing in the role of\\nthe physical environment and with numerous gradu-\\nate students. Several architectural design brainstorm-\\ning meetings were held.\\nWe then created a simulation that consisted of\\na large mock-up of the proposed ICU, including\\na nurses’ station, patient rooms, booms, and family\\nareas.

Videographers recorded everything\\nfor later analysis.\\nWe changed designs as we learned from such expe-\\nriences. We originally planned to distribute the nurses’\\nstations throughout the ICU but later decided to keep\\na communal area as well, recognizing that nurses and\\ndoctors like to be with each other and need to support\\none another.\\nAbout 50 family members of patients who had gradu-\\nated from or were still in the critical care unit were\\ninvolved with the unit’s design throughout the process.\\nPROPOSAL BECOMES REALITY\\nQ\\nThe new unit opened February 2007. The new rooms\\nrange from 345 to 450 square feet, compared with\\n120 to 200 square feet for the old rooms. Each room\\nis a suite, consisting of the patient room and a family\\narea separated by a curved wall with large glass-block\\nwindows that let in light and create a cocoon-like\\neffect (Figure 1). The family area has a table, chairs,\\ncomfortable sleeping arrangements, a fl at-screen tele-\\nvision, wireless Internet access, music, and a white-\\nnoise system to blunt surrounding noises.\\nThe new unit allows us to do things we could not\\ndo before. I can now easily hold a private conversation\\nwith a family member when I visit a patient. Family\\nmembers can leave the room for some respite and still\\nbe just a stone’s throw away from their loved one.\\nPatient rooms are much bigger than before, and the\\nbooms lift a lot of equipment off the fl oor.

The arti-\\ncle opened as follows: “For decades, hospitals tried to\\nkeep visitors out of intensive-care units for more than\\na few minutes at a time. This year, Emory University\\nHospital here went the other way: It began inviting\\nfamily members to move into the ward and take a\\nhand in the patient’s care.”2 I think the reporter cap-\\ntured the key idea well, but I would change the word\\n“visitors” to “participants” to indicate that patients’\\nfamily members really have a degree of responsibility.\\nThere were interesting comments from readers in\\nresponse to the article.

Any involvement beyond that should be\\nlimited to what is medically benefi cial to the patient.”\\nAnother comment, probably from someone who\\nworks in an ICU, was, “This sounds more like a market-\\ning ploy by hospital administrators than a plan devel-\\noped by the nurses and physicians in the trenches.”\\nInterestingly, administrators at Emory resisted the\\nchanges because of the high expense. Although the\\ntone of this comment seems cynical, the writer brings\\nup a valid danger—that limited health care resources\\npotentially could be diverted from the patient to the\\nfamily. But although care that fosters family participa-\\ntion costs more money and takes more energy, what\\nmatters is that we are doing a better job for patients\\nand their families.\\nQ BENEFITS OF FAMILY-CENTERED UNITS:\\nA CASE STUDY\\nThe following case study illustrates some of the advan-\\ntages of our new family-centered unit.\\nDavid was a 31-year-old computer programmer, the\\nfather of a 3-year-old girl, and about to be married.\\nHe came in with a grade 3 subarachnoid hemorrhage\\nfrom a severe carotid intracranial aneurysm. He was\\nin the old neurocritical care unit for 4 or 5 days, and\\nthen was moved to the new unit when it opened.\\nThe family—David’s parents and his fi ancée—\\nkept a rotating vigil. The Wall Street Journal article\\ndescribed how they always felt that they were in the\\nway in the old ICU, whereas they felt welcome in the\\nnew facility. The family often stood at David’s bed-\\nside as the team explained the purpose of the complex\\nmonitors and instruments. The mother said, “This was\\nour home for a month, and it got so that the nurses\\ncould tell when we needed a hug.”2\\nAfter 2 weeks, David developed neurogenic pulmo-\\nnary edema, severe pneumonia, acute respiratory dis-\\ntress syndrome, and heart failure. We induced a coma\\nto protect his brain from high intracranial pressure\\nand placed hypothermia catheters to lower his core\\ntemperature in an attempt to better oxygenate him.\\nJust as he was getting better, the aneurysm ruptured\\nagain, and we knew that recovery was hopeless.\\nThe family was by his bedside 24 hours a day and\\nknew that the medical team was as well. They wit-\\nnessed the whole situation and understood when we\\nran out of options. As David’s parents and fi ancée\\ngathered at the bedside, I told them that David had\\nprogressed to brain death. Shortly after that, the team\\nthat arranged organ donation came to speak with\\nDavid’s parents, and they elected to donate. They\\nwere grateful for the time they had with him and for\\nthe way they were treated. David’s father said, “No one\\never misled us or told us anything but the truth…and\\nmost importantly, we were there for everything.”2\\nWe did everything we could for David, and noth-\\ning could change his ultimate outcome. But I think\\nthat the way someone dies is incredibly important.\\nThe circumstances of how he was treated probably\\nhelped allow the family to donate David’s organs and\\nbetter come to terms with his death. They later gen-\\nerously donated their time to help the neurocritical\\ncare unit develop the family-centered approach we\\nwanted by participating in many discussions about\\ntheir experiences.\\nFAMILY-CENTERED UNITS POSE CHALLENGES\\nQ\\nUnits that are designed for both patients and their\\nfamilies bring to the fore enormous issues that arise\\nin the ICU daily.

Dedicated neurointensivists have been shown to improve outcome measurements in the neurosciences intensive care\\nunit (NSICU). Quality outcome data in relation to patient and family satisfaction is lacking. This study evaluated the impact\\nof newly appointed neurointensivists and creation of a neurocritical care team on quality outcome measures including patient\\nsatisfaction in a NSICU. Methods. This is a retrospective study of data over 36 months from a 14-bed NSICU evaluating quality\\noutcome measures and anonymous patient satisfaction questionnaires before and after neurointensivists appointment. Results.\\nAfter appointment of neurointensivists, patient acuity of the NSICU increased by 33.4% while LOS decreased by 3.5%. There was a\\ndecrease in neurosciences mortality (35.8%), catheter-associated urinary tract infection (50%), central line associated bloodstream\\ninfection (100%), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (50%). During the same time, patient satisfaction increased by 28.3% on\\nphysicians/nurses consistency (𝑝= 0.025), by 69.5% in confidence/trust in physicians (𝑝< 0.0001), by 78.3% on physicians treated\\nme with courtesy/respect (𝑝< 0.0001), and by 46.4% on physicians’ attentiveness (𝑝< 0.0001). Ultimately, patients recommending\\nthe hospital to others increased by 67.5% (𝑝< 0.0001). Conclusion. Dedicated neurointensivists and the subsequent development\\nof a neurocritical care team positively impacted quality outcome metrics, particularly significantly improving patient satisfaction.\\n1. Introduction\\nNeurointensive care is an area of medicine bridging multiple\\nfields to provide specialized care to critically ill patients\\nwith neurological illnesses [1, 2]. The neurointensivist serves\\nan important role orchestrating personnel, neurologists,\\nneurosurgeons, consultants, therapists, pharmacists, nursing,\\nand administration, involved in patient care in the neu-\\nrosciences intensive care unit (NSICU). This orchestrater\\nrole is important for patient outcome and healthcare quality\\n[3, 4]. Studies have shown that a neurointensivist manag-\\ning a NSICU improves outcomes and shortens length of\\nstays in all neurocritically ill patients and also improves\\ndocumentation [5–9]. Similar improvements after dedicated\\nneurointensivists have been demonstrated in patients with\\nischemic stroke [9–14], subarachnoid hemorrhage [15, 16],\\ntraumatic brain injury [17, 18], intracerebral hemorrhage [19],\\nand neuromuscular respiratory failure [20]. These studies,\\nhowever, lack information on patient and family satisfaction\\nconcomitantly with the improvement in other clinical quality\\nmetrics.\\nThe purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact\\nof newly appointed neurointensivists with the subsequent\\ndevelopment of a neurocritical care team on quality metrics\\nincluding patient and family satisfaction after discharge from\\na NSICU at an academic, tertiary care medical center.\\nHindawi\\nCritical Care Research and Practice\\nVolume 2017, Article ID 6394105, 6 pages\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1155/2017/6394105\\n2\\nCritical Care Research and Practice\\nTable 1: Patient satisfaction questionnaire.\\nQuestions\\n(1)\\nHow often were the different doctors and nurses consistent with each other in providing you information and care?\\n(2)\\nDuring this hospital stay, how often did you have confidence and trust in the doctors treating you?\\n(3)\\nDuring this hospital stay, how often did doctors treat you with courtesy and respect?\\n(4)\\nDuring this hospital stay, how often did doctors listen carefully to you?\\n(5)\\nWould you recommend this hospital to your friends and family?\\n2. Methods\\nThis was a retrospective study of anonymous patient surveys\\nand quality metric data from a 14-bed NSICU at an academic,\\ntertiary care center over a 36-month time period (January\\n2014 to January 2017). 18 months were reviewed before\\nappointment of neurointensivists and were compared to a\\nsimilar 18-month time frame after appointment of neuroin-\\ntensivists (CRN and PN). The Institutional Review Board\\napproved this study.\\n2.1. Survey Patient Population. Quality metrics data included\\ncatheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI), Foley\\ncatheter days, central line associated blood stream infec-\\ntion (CLABSI), central line days, ventilator-associated pneu-\\nmonia (VAP), ventilator days, patient acuity, mortality\\n(observed : expected ratio), length of stay (LOS), and patient\\ndays. These metrics were obtained from University Health\\nSystem Consortium (UHC; Irving, TX, USA), National\\nHealthcare Safety Network (NHSN; Atlanta, GA, USA),\\nand Acuity Plus databases (Herndon, VA, USA). Anony-\\nmous survey data was obtained from patient satisfaction\\nquestionnaires after discharge from the NSICU using the\\nNational Research Council (NRC) Picker database (Lincoln,\\nNE, USA). The Likert scale questionnaire included ques-\\ntions related to (1) physicians and nurses consistency; (2)\\nconfidence and trust in physicians; (3) courtesy and respect\\nby physicians; (4) attentiveness of physicians; (5) recom-\\nmending the hospital to others. The questions can be found\\nin Table 1. Data were compared after the appointment of\\nneurointensivists (CRN and PN) and dedicated neurocritical\\ncare team to controls from the immediate 18 months before\\nappointment. Before the appointment of neurointensivists,\\nthe NSICU was managed as an open ICU by neurologists\\nand neurosurgeons with the assistance of consulting medical\\nintensivists and advanced practice providers. Not all patients\\nrequired a consultation from the medical intensive care team.\\nAfter the appointment of the neurointensivists and creation\\nof the neurocritical care team, the NSICU operated as a high\\nintensity ICU model.\\n2.2. Establishment of the NSICU\\n2.2.1. Clinical Improvement. The main focus was on clinical\\nimprovement in key areas: ICU team, coordination of care,\\nfamily and patient involvement in their care, nursing involve-\\nment during rounding, and creation of checklists, protocols,\\nand order sets. The NSICU team worked closely with the\\nadmitting service, neurology or neurosurgery, to develop\\nthorough plans for the patients’ care.\\nRounding occurred at the bedside in patients’ rooms.\\nThe neurointensivist directed the rounding. Families were\\nencouraged to participate in rounding. Nurses provided\\na brief overview of the patient followed by neurological\\nexamination and neurological specific data (e.g., external\\nventricular device setting and output, changes in exami-\\nnation, planned neuroimaging, sedation, and pain control)\\nfollowed by other pertinent information and data (e.g., vitals,\\nins and outs, bowel regimen and diet, blood glucose trends,\\nrespiratory status, inflammatory/infectious status, ending\\nwith deep venous thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis, and skin\\nconcerns). Immediately following the nurse presentation, the\\ndedicated neuropharmacist reviewed medications with the\\nteam. The resident and/or advanced practice providers then\\ndiscussed the plan by organ system with the neurointensivist.\\nThis format allowed for bedside teaching of management of\\nthe neurocritically ill patient. The resident/advance practice\\nproviders’ progress note was specific to the needs of the\\ncritically ill neurosciences patient and followed the same\\nformat as the nurses rounding report. Finally, an eleven-point\\nchecklist ensured basic care of an ICU patient was completed.\\nThis checklist was based on the “ABCDEF” ICU bundle\\n(http://www.icudelirium.org/). The rounding NSICU team\\nconsisted of nurses, advance practice providers, residents,\\nmedical students, critical care fellows rotating from other\\nunits, pharmacist, and respiratory therapist.\\nPrior to formal rounding each morning, a multidis-\\nciplinary meeting with the neurology, neurosurgery, and\\nNSICU teams occurred to discuss all patients in the NSICU.\\nAt this meeting, the plans of care were reviewed with social\\nwork, case management, nutrition, speech/language pathol-\\nogy, respiratory therapy, and physical and occupational ther-\\napy to ensure consistent disposition plan. A separate huddle\\nalso occurs with nursing prior to formal rounds to review the\\nneed for catheters, central lines, and ventilators.\\nTo ensure maintenance of quality, a weekly meeting\\noccurred with nursing leadership of the NSICU in addition to\\nthe neurosurgery and neurology service leadership to discuss\\nnursing and unit concerns and improvement opportunities.\\nDuring these meetings, we addressed mortalities, documen-\\ntation, grievances, and future plans. Additional monthly\\nmeetings with infection control reviewed VAPs, CAUTIs,\\nmortalities, and patient safety network concerns.\\nProtocols and order sets were created specific for the\\nNSICU. These served as a basis for educating other members\\nof the team as well as standardizing care delivered.\\n3537, 2017, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2017/6394105 by Cochrane France, Wiley Online Library on [17/01/2026].

Despite this increase in acuity, the mor-\\ntality and length of stay decreased. Prior to the appointment\\nof neurointensivists, higher acuity patients were admitted to\\nthe medical intensive care unit with neurology consulting.\\nThese critically ill neurosciences patients were now managed\\nby neurointensivists in the NSICU. We hypothesized that\\nachieving these goals of decreasing LOS and mortality was\\nlargely in part because of having specially trained neuroin-\\ntensivists and dedicated neurocritical care team managing\\nthe critically ill patient, establishing protocols and order sets\\nspecific to neurologically injured patients, and focusing on\\nnursing education and engagement. The multidisciplinary\\napproach to the patient created an open discussion with nurs-\\ning and therapists about the patients. This approach possibly\\nimproved our CAUTI, CLABSI, and VAP rates likely by the\\nreduction in our line and catheter days. The absolute numbers\\nare small, which may overstate the significance. Ventilator\\ndays also significantly decreased by a small absolute amount\\n(i.e., 7 ventilator days).\\nThe decrease in the observed-to-expected mortality ratio\\n(i.e., a risk-adjusted measure of the overall mortality) can\\nbe accomplished by two methods. One is to increase the\\nexpected mortality. The other is to decrease the observed\\nmortality. The expected mortality is calculated based on\\npremorbid and comorbid conditions recorded in a patient\\npopulation that are beyond control of the hospital. The\\nobserved mortality is the actual number of deaths. It can be\\nargued that documentation improved with the appointment\\nof the neurointensivists, which ultimately decreased the\\nobserved-to-expected ratio. However, prior to the appoint-\\nment of the neurointensivists, the institution had standard-\\nized collection of key coding words in admission and progress\\nnotes for the expected mortality variable, which has largely\\nremained unchanged. Overall, the decrease in the observed-\\nto-expected rate was likely a combination of improved docu-\\nmentation (which increased the expected mortality denom-\\ninator) as well as an actual decrease in mortality (which\\ndecreased the observed mortality numerator).\\nOur data is consistent with the retrospective study by\\nSuarez et al. [5]. This group showed that after the introduction\\nof a neurointensivist and neurocritical care team, mortality\\nand length of stay significantly decreased. They hypothesized\\nthat the driving factors of the improved outcomes were from\\nICU organization including staffing with physicians that were\\nreadily available to critically ill patients as well as creating a\\nhigh intensity intensive care unit model [5]. The benefits of a\\nhigh intensity model have been shown by Durbin Jr. [3]. In a\\nhigh intensity model of ICU care delivery, where all orders are\\nplaced by ICU team and all patients in the ICU are seen by the\\nICU team, mortality decreased (OR 0.61; 95% CI 0.05–0.75)\\nand ICU and hospital lengths of stay decreased [3, 21]. Durbin\\nJr. estimated that 30–50% fewer patients would die if an\\nintensivist rounded daily on all critically ill patients [3]. They\\nhypothesized that this model allowed for more rapid inter-\\nvention and prevention of potentially catastrophic events [3].\\nIndeed, in the medical ICU, mortality from septic shock\\ndecreased from 74 to 57% by having an intensivist and all ICU\\nmortality decreased from 20.9 to 14.9% [3]. Mortality actually\\nincreased by a factor of three if there was not a daily ICU\\nphysician led round [3, 8]. Finally, the intensivist was defined\\nas a person who “makes all final decisions about the care of the\\npatients, including who is admitted and discharged, which\\nphysicians to consult, and all other aspects of care” [22].\\nBarriers to work as a team are known. These include\\nphysicians and the health professionals being slow to accept\\nchange, relinquishing some autonomy to become a team\\nmember, other physicians feel loss of authority, patient\\ncontrol, and personal income [3]. A well-functioning team\\nhas been shown to provide better care than a single physician\\ndictating care from a remote site [3].\\nThe benefits of a critical care team extend beyond just\\nhaving a dedicated intensivist. Other factors that improve\\npatient outcomes include keeping nurse-to-patient ratio of\\nless than 1 : 2 [3, 22], having a dedicated pharmacist on rounds\\n[3], and having a dedicated respiratory therapist [3]. We have\\nalso shown that the rates of CAUTI, CLABSI, and VAPs\\ndecreased after development of a dedicated team managing\\nthe critically ill neurosciences patient. The decreased infec-\\ntion rate from CLABSI, CAUTI, and VAP can be cost saving\\nbased on 2016 national average data provided by the Health\\nServices Advisory Group (https://www.hsag.com/). Indeed,\\nmanaging neurologically injured patients in a dedicated neu-\\nrocritical care unit is cost-effective compared to combined\\nneuro/general critical care units [21].\\nPatient satisfaction improved with the development of\\na neurocritical care team led by a neurointensivist. We\\nhave shown that patient and family satisfaction improved\\non physician attentiveness and consistency, confidence/trust\\nin the physician, and treatment with respect and courtesy.\\nUltimately, the patients and families recommended the hos-\\npital to others. These improvements reflect the high intensity\\nmodel that was created. By having an intensivist led ICU, the\\nadmitting physician (either neurology or neurosurgery) can\\nspend more time performing surgery and/or seeing patients\\nin clinic by being freed of the need to provide care on\\na minute-to-minute basis to critically ill patients [3]. This\\nmodel has been shown to be less alienating compared to a\\nclosed ICU model [3]. The high intensity model encourages\\ncommunication between the different services, which ulti-\\nmately provides the best care for the patient. In the neurocriti-\\ncal care unit, this model has been shown to be effective [8, 14].\\nAn important aspect we noticed was our rounding style.\\nRounding occurred at bedside, which encouraged patients\\nand families to participate in rounds and decisions. This\\ntype of rounding style allowed for transparency in decision\\nmaking. It also encouraged open communication between\\nthe families, patients, and neurocritical care team.\\nIn comparison to the other satisfaction questions, physi-\\ncian and nurse consistency only improved by 28.3% with the\\ndevelopment of the neurocritical care team. We suspect this\\nwas a reflection of a high intensity model (i.e., not a closed\\nICU model) as well as the inherent nature of an intensive care\\nunit. Nurses worked three 12-hour shifts that caused constant\\nchange and less continuity with care of the patient requiring\\na prolonged ICU stay. Nurses also rotated from other units\\nwithout having the specialized foundation of neurocritical\\ncare that is necessary to communicate with families and\\n3537, 2017, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2017/6394105 by Cochrane France, Wiley Online Library on [17/01/2026].

Similarly, residents rotated on two-week blocks\\nthrough the NSICU. Night-time was covered by a night-float\\nresident who may not fully understand the details of the plan\\nas discussed during the day. Rotating residents come from\\nvarying backgrounds - neurology, neurosurgery, emergency\\nmedicine, and family medicine. Lastly, the timing of rounds\\nby the other services can be a source of miscommunication.\\nThe results of the patient satisfaction questionnaire and\\npossible sources for inconsistencies have provided us with\\ninformation on areas for improvement.\\nImprovement in patient satisfaction and quality met-\\nrics have become increasingly crucial in reimbursements\\nfrom payors. The restructuring of reimbursements by health\\ninsurances places specific emphasis on quality metrics and\\npatient satisfaction [23]. Future projects will be aimed at\\nimproving consistency in the communication with patients\\nand families and ultimately determining the financial benefits\\nto the hospital by the improved patient satisfaction scores.\\nRetrospective studies have inherent limitations. A limi-\\ntation of this study was that not all families/patients returned\\nquestionnaires or fully completed questionnaires. It is unclear\\nhow many questionnaires were originally mailed to patients.\\nThe questionnaires were administered by an independent\\nagency. Thus, we cannot calculate the response rate. The\\nquestionnaires were answered after discharge from hospital;\\nthus, answers may be biased by post-ICU care. We limited our\\nanalysis to the specific questions relating to the NSICU. We\\ndo recognize that the care patients receive after ICU can bias\\ntheir overall reflection of the hospital experience. Addition-\\nally, the number of surveys returned after the appointment\\nof the neurointensivists was less than before appointment.\\nThis discrepancy was a reflection of the growth of the ICU.\\nThe acuity of the patients in the ICU has increased since\\nthe neurointensivists were appointed. As such, many of these\\npatients after neurointensivist appointment were discharged\\nto a long-term acute care facility, skilled nursing facility, or\\nacute rehabilitation center. Patients who were not discharged\\nhome were not surveyed. Lastly, we do not have data from\\nother intensive care units during this same time period for\\ncomparison.\\nTo overcome the limitations, families were actively\\nengaged in rounds. A nursing position was created to focus\\non education and research. The neurocritical care team\\nworked with nursing and neurology/neurosurgery leader-\\nship on methods to improve consistent message to the\\npatients/families. The messages emphasized included team\\ndiscussions prior to prognosticating, open communication,\\nand increased interface with the other services, simplifying\\nthe clinical information provided to families/patients and\\nimproving the structure of nursing and multidisciplinary\\nhuddles.\\nIn conclusion, our data is the first to show improvement\\nin anonymous satisfaction scores from patients discharged\\nfrom a NSICU in relation to other quality metrics after the\\nimplementation of a neurointensivist-led, high intensity ICU\\nmodel. Our data is consistent with prior studies showing\\nimprovement in iatrogenic infections and a decrease in\\nmortality and LOS with dedicated neurointensivists and a\\nneurocritical care team.\\nDisclosure\\nThis manuscript was presented at the 2nd Annual Mayo\\nNeurocritical Care Review and Workshop in Orlando, FL,\\nMay 13, 2016, and also at the Neurocritical Care Society\\nAnnual Meeting in National Harbor, MD, September 15–18,\\n2016.\\nConflicts of Interest\\nThe authors have no financial conflicts of interest to report.\\nAuthors’ Contributions\\nAll the authors contributed equally to the writing of the case\\nand formatting the images.\\nReferences\\n[1] E.

       " 'Introduction\\nThe costs associated with traumatic brain injury (TBI) in Europe\\nhave been estimated at 23.7 billion USD (US$37 billion; Wittchen et\\nal., 2011), which is a major health concern considering TBI incidence\\nis increasing due to road traffic accidents (European Commission,\\nn.d.). Common sequelae after brain injury include psychosocial (Cun-\\nningham, Chan, & Jones, 1999), physical (Lynch, 1986), and cogni-\\ntive impairments (Malkesman, Tucker, Ozl, & McCabe, 2013), as\\nwell as neuropsychiatric symptoms (e.g., depression, anxiety, irrita-\\nbility; Benedictus, Spikman, & van der Naalt, 2010). These impair-\\nments often necessitate an informal caregiver, and because of the\\nsudden nature of TBI, caregivers are often unprepared to as-\\nsume this role (Sinnakaruppan & Williams, 2001).\\nThe caregivers of individuals with TBI are often uniquely chal-\\nlenged because of the variety of deficits that TBI patients may\\nexperience. Loss of function is typically seen in more than one\\ndomain (e.g., physical, cognitive), with the deficits impacting most\\nareas of the patients’ and caregivers’ lives. Consequently, the role\\nof the caregiver is complex and can range from providing daily\\ncare to navigating insurance companies and lawyers.\\nThis article was published Online First October 17, 2016.\\nMichael Trujillo and Paul B.

Outcomes associated with\\nbeing a TBI caregiver are well documented and include reduced\\nquality of life (Livingston et al., 2010; Norup, Snipes, et al., 2013);\\npoor social functioning, increased stress, and burden (Nonterah et\\nal., 2013); and depression and anxiety (Doser & Norup, 2016;\\nManskow et al., 2014; Norup, Kristensen, Poulsen, Nielsen, &\\nMortensen, 2013; Norup, Siert, & Mortensen, 2010; Perrin et al.,\\n2013).\\nCaregivers’ psychosocial functioning is directly associated with\\nthe quality of care that they provide to the person with the brain\\ninjury (Vangel, Rapport, & Hanks, 2011), which suggests a need\\nfor further investigation to understand the influences on caregiver\\nmental health. Prior research has indicated that caregivers’ lower\\nsatisfaction with life is associated with greater caregiver burden\\nand depression (Kreutzer et al., 2009), and poor family functioning\\nis also associated with higher caregiver strain (Gan, Campbell,\\nGemeinhardt, & McFadden, 2006).\\nSpecific impairments after brain injury are also associated with\\ncaregiver mental health. Cognitive and physical deficits have\\nshown a strong association with caregiver distress (Anderson et al.,\\n2009; Brooks, Campsie, Symington, Beattie, & McKinlay, 1987;\\nNorup, Welling, Qvist, Siert, & Mortensen, 2012), even up to 5\\nyears postinjury (Ponsford & Schönberger, 2010). Similarly, care-\\ngiver depression and anxiety have been associated with cognitive,\\nbehavioral, and emotional changes in individuals with brain injury\\n(Ponsford, Olver, Ponsford, & Nelms, 2003). However, most of\\nthe findings have been reported in cross-sectional studies; few\\nlongitudinal studies have investigated mental health in caregivers\\nover time, but those that do have suggested that symptoms of\\nanxiety and depression decrease (Norup, Petersen, & Mortensen,\\n2015) and quality of life increases (Norup, Snipes, et al., 2013)\\nduring the first year after injury.\\nOne facet of care that is receiving growing, albeit limited,\\nattention is the association between caregivers’ personality traits\\nand their mental and physical health (Bookwala & Schulz, 1998;\\nHooker, Monahan, Shifren, & Hutchinson, 1992; Kim, Duberstein,\\nSörensen, & Larson, 2005; Löckenhoff, Duberstein, Friedman, &\\nCosta, 2011). TBI caregivers are typically not prepared for their\\ncaregiving role because of the sudden onset of TBI, and conse-\\nquently many caregivers may draw on preexisting psychosocial\\ncharacteristics such as personality traits in order to adjust to the\\nnovel demands of their new role (McClendon & Smyth, 2013).\\nOne of the more common conceptualizations of personality\\nstructure uses a five-factor model (Goldberg, 1990). In this model,\\npersonality can largely be described as consisting of five dimen-\\nsions: neuroticism (tendency to experience negative emotions),\\nextraversion (sociability, excitability, and tendency to experience\\npositive emotions), openness to experience (appreciation for a\\nvariety of experiences), conscientiousness (self-discipline and or-\\nganization), and agreeableness (altruism and willingness to coop-\\nerate with others; McCrae & Costa, 1987).\\nResearch on caregivers of individuals with other types of con-\\nditions such as dementia, stroke, and cancer has reported that\\ncaregivers high in neuroticism have been shown to have more\\ndepression (Gallant & Connell, 2003), greater caregiver burden\\nand distress (Markiewicz, Reis, & Gold, 1997), increased sensi-\\ntivity to caregiver-related stressors (Bookwala & Schulz, 1998),\\ndysfunctional coping strategies (Hooker, Frazier, & Monahan,\\n1994), and worse subjective mental health (Hooker et al., 1992).\\nCaregivers high in extraversion display less depression (Kim et al.,\\n2005), lower burden and strain (Gallant & Connell, 2003), more\\nadaptive coping strategies (Hooker et al., 1994), and better mental\\nand physical health (Hooker et al., 1992). Similarly, caregivers\\nhigh in conscientiousness report greater adaptive coping strategies\\n(Hooker et al., 1994), more benefit-finding in the caregiving ex-\\nperience (Hollis-Sawyer, 2003), and lower sensitivity to caregiver-\\nrelated stressors (Koerner & Kenyon, 2007). And finally, caregiv-\\ners with high agreeableness report less maladaptive coping\\nstrategies (Hooker et al., 1994) and more benefit-finding (Koerner,\\nKenyon, & Shirai, 2009), whereas those higher on openness to\\nexperience tend to experience positive perceptions of the caregiv-\\ning experience (Hollis-Sawyer, 2003).\\nMost research on caregiver mental health within the field of\\nbrain injury has investigated the potential influence of impairments\\nin the individual with TBI (Nonterah et al., 2013; Norup et al.,\\n2010), as well as external factors such as social support (Stevens\\net al., 2013). However, no research has examined the relationship\\nbetween personality traits and mental health outcomes among\\ncaregivers of persons with brain injury using cross-sectional or\\nlongitudinal methods. Therefore, the aim of the current study was\\nto use hierarchal linear modeling to examine whether Danish\\ncaregivers’ personality traits were predictive of their trajectories of\\nmental health-related quality of life (HRQoL), anxiety, and de-\\npression beginning at the patients’ stay in a neurointensive care\\nunit through 1 year after injury. It was hypothesized that symptoms\\nof anxiety and depression would decrease and health-related qual-\\nity of life would increase during the first year after injury. Fur-\\nthermore, it was expected that higher levels of neuroticism would\\nbe associated with more prolonged trajectories of anxiety and\\ndepression.\\nMethod\\nParticipants\\nParticipants were 52 family members of patients with severe\\nbrain injury admitted for intensive neurorehabilitation in Denmark\\nat the Clinic of Neurorehabilitation, Traumatic Brain Injury Unit,\\nRigshospitalet. All family members consented to participate in the\\nClinic of Neurorehabilitation, Traumatic Brain Injury Unit study.\\nIf more than one family member was present at enrollment, the\\nfamily decided which family member should participate. Inclusion\\ncriteria were that participants had to be (a) at least 18 years old, (b)\\nDanish speaking, and (c) without a current psychiatric diagnosis or\\nprogressive brain disease (e.g., dementia). Family members had a\\nmean age of 49.44 years (SD \\x02 12.78). Additional demographic\\ninformation appears in Table 1.\\nAll patients had been admitted to intensive neurorehabilitation\\nand had severe brain injury (TBI or nontraumatic brain injury\\n[NTBI]) as indicated by a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS; Teasdale &\\nJennett, 1974) score between 3 and 9. Patients with a GCS above\\n9 were included only if their injury included severe focal neuro-\\nlogical deficits such as aphasia, agitation, or hemiparesis. All\\npatients had completed neurosurgery (if applicable) and were\\nrespiratorily stable. The mean age of patients was 40.97 years\\n(SD \\x02 19.38).\\nThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.\\nThis article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.\\n390\\nTRUJILLO, PERRIN, DOSER, AND NORUP\\nMeasures\\nShort Form–36 (SF-36).\\nThe SF-36 (Stewart & Ware, 1992)\\nis a widely used self-report measure of health-related quality of life\\n(HRQoL). This 36-item measure has been used in both individuals\\nwith TBI (Guilfoyle et al., 2010) and in TBI caregivers (Arango-\\nLasprilla et al., 2011; McPherson, Pentland, & McNaughton,\\n2000). Only four subscales focusing on caregivers’ psychosocial\\nfunctioning were used for the purpose of this study: Vitality, Social\\nFunctioning, Role Limitations–Emotional (performance of role as\\naffected by emotional factors), and Mental Health. Subscale scores\\nrange from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better HRQoL.\\nScores were evaluated in terms of Danish norms on the basis of\\ngender (Bjorner, Damsgaard, Watt, & Bech, 1997).\\nSymptom Checklist-90–Revised (SCL-90-R).\\nThe SCL-\\n90-R (Derogatis, 1994) is a 90-item self-report inventory used to\\nassess psychological distress. Only the depression and anxiety\\nsubscales were used for this study, and higher scores indicate\\ngreater symptom severity. The scales have been validated in Dan-\\nish, and a population study revealed high alpha coefficients on the\\ndepression and anxiety scales (\\x03 \\x02 .91 and \\x03 \\x02 .86, respectively;\\nOlsen, Mortensen, & Bech, 2006).\\nGlasgow Coma Scale (GCS).\\nThe GCS assesses the degree of\\nconsciousness in individuals with brain injury (Teasdale & Jennett,\\n1974). Assessment factors include eye movement, motor ability,\\nand verbal comprehension. Together these factors provide a total\\nscore of responsiveness and range from 3 (not conscious, indica-\\ntive of severe brain injury) to 15 (full consciousness). Scores on\\nthe GCS were assessed at admission to early intensive rehabilita-\\ntion.\\nNEO Personality Inventory Revised (NEO-PI-R).\\nThe\\nNEO-PI-R is an empirically derived 240-item self-report measure\\nof five major domains of adult personality (Costa & McCrae, 1992).\\nThe five traits and their corresponding facets (in parentheses) include\\nneuroticism (anxiety, anger hostility, depression, self-consciousness,\\nimpulsiveness, vulnerability), extraversion (warmth, gregariousness,\\nassertiveness, activity, excitement seeking, positive emotions), open-\\nness (fantasy, aesthetics, feelings, actions, ideas, values), agree-\\nableness (trust, straightforwardness, altruism, compliance, mod-\\nesty, tender-mindedness), and conscientiousness (competence,\\norder, dutifulness, achievement striving, self-discipline, delibera-\\ntion). Internal consistency of the Danish version across domains\\nhas ranged from .86 to .91 (Costa & McCrae, 2004). The NEO-\\nPI-R was completed by all participants 3 months after the patients’\\ndischarge from rehabilitation in order to reduce the chances that\\ncoping with a family member’s acute brain injury would cause\\ndramatic changes in participants’ scores on this measure.\\nProcedure\\nParticipants completed the outcome measures, the SF-36, and\\nthe anxiety and depression subscales from the SCL-90-R across\\nfive waves. Time points included while the person with brain\\ninjury was (a) in the neurointensive care unit, (b) at admission to\\nearly intensive rehabilitation, (c) at discharge from rehabilitation,\\n(d) at 3 months postdischarge, and (e) at 1 year postinjury. Care-\\ngivers completed the NEO-PI-R assessment at 3 months post-\\ndischarge. About half of the sample provided data in the neuroin-\\ntensive care unit, in part due to the chaotic nature of this time\\nperiod, with many families and caregivers being unavailable, lim-\\niting the ability to substantively recruit participants at this time\\npoint. The Danish Data Protection Agency (2007-41-0583) and the\\nCommittees on Biomedical Research Ethics of the Capital Region\\nof Denmark (S-KF-311150) provided study approval. All patients\\ngave their informed consent according to the Helsinki Declaration.\\nData Analyses\\nSix separate hierarchical linear models (HLMs) were performed\\nto predict family members’ four mental HRQoL SF-36, anxiety,\\nand depression scores across 1 year after the patient’s injury (see\\nTable 2). All six models included time and the five NEO person-\\nality subscale scores as predictors, with the personality scores\\ntreated as continuous variables. Time and the NEO scores were all\\ncentered and entered simultaneously as fixed effects into each\\nHLM. The four subscales of the HRQoL (Vitality, Social Func-\\ntioning, Role Limitations–Emotional, Mental Health), as well as\\nanxiety and depression scores, were examined separately as out-\\ncome variables. Intercepts but not slopes were included as random\\neffects in all models, and within-subject residuals were treated as\\nindependent. Data collected at baseline (neurointensive care unit)\\nwere coded as 0, with each sequential follow-up coded in numer-\\nical order—admission to rehabilitation as 1; discharge from reha-\\nTable 1\\nCharacteristics of Patients With Brain Injury and Their\\nFamily Members\\nVariable\\nn (%)\\nM \\x04 SD\\nRange\\nFamily members (n \\x02 52)\\nGender\\nFemale\\n41 (78.8)\\nMale\\n11 (21.2)\\nRelationship\\nSpouse\\n18 (34.6)\\nParent\\n22 (42.3)\\nChildren\\n6 (11.5)\\nSiblings\\n2 (3.8)\\nBoy- or girlfriend\\n2 (3.8)\\nOthers\\n2 (3.8)\\nOccupational status\\nFull-time work\\n45 (86.5)\\nPension\\n5 (9.6)\\nUnknown\\n2 (3.8)\\nCohabitant status: Cohabiting\\nwith the patient\\n31 (59.6)\\nPatients (n \\x02 52)\\nGender\\nFemale\\n15 (28.8)\\nMale\\n37 (71.2)\\nInjury\\nTraumatic\\n39 (75.0)\\nNontraumatic\\n13 (25.0)\\nInfarction\\n5 (9.6)\\nCardiac arrest\\n2 (3.8)\\nSubarachnoid hemorrhage\\n3 (5.8)\\nTumor\\n2 (3.8)\\nSpontaneous intracranial\\nhemorrhage\\n1 (1.9)\\nGCS\\n11.34 \\x04 3.08\\n5–15\\nLOS\\n111.44 \\x04 50.32\\n12–210\\nNote.\\nGCS \\x02 Glasgow Coma Scale; LOS \\x02 length of stay.\\nThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.\\nThis article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.\\n391\\nPERSONALITY TRAITS IN CAREGIVERS\\nbilitation as 2; 3 months postdischarge as 3; and 1 year postinjury\\nas 4. Because of substantial individual variability in the time\\nintervals between assessments, we coded time with equally spaced\\nintegers from 0 to 4. The analyses therefore reflect difference\\nacross waves of data collection but do not necessarily reflect actual\\ntime spacing between waves.\\nAfter each of the six primary HLMs, follow-up HLMs were run\\nto examine whether any of the statistically significant fixed effects\\nin the first models interacted significantly with time in the predic-\\ntion of the outcome variable, which would indicate that the trajec-\\ntories of the outcome changed differentially over time as a function\\nof one of the NEO-PI-R personality subscales. As in the first set of\\nanalyses, only intercepts were included as random effects in all\\nmodels, and within-subject residuals were treated as independent.\\nAll HLM analyses utilized the maximum-likelihood estimation\\nmethod and were conducted using SPSS Version 22.0. Variance-\\nexplained effect sizes (similar to the R2 in ordinary least squares\\nregression for within-subject or repeated-measure level) proposed\\nby Snijders and Bosker (1994) were computed for each model.\\nThis effect size is commonly reported in research with linear\\ngrowth models (Snijders & Bosker, 1994).\\nResults\\nThe sample consisted of caregivers for both TBI and NTBI\\npatients, because both patient groups receive the same treatment\\nand rehabilitation in the unit. No significant differences associated\\nwith etiology of the injury were found in relation to caregiver\\noutcomes, and consequently, data were treated as being homoge-\\nnous. All parameters estimates are unstandardized and should be\\ninterpreted within the context of the scale from which the predictor\\nvariable is derived.\\nVitality\\nIn the first HLM, with vitality as the dependent variable, time\\nwas a statistically significant predictor (b \\x02 5.50, SE \\x02 .83, p \\x05\\n.001), such that vitality scores improved across all five time points.\\nNeuroticism (b \\x02 \\x06.33, SE \\x02 .12, p \\x02 .010) and conscientious-\\nness (b \\x02 \\x06.40, SE \\x02 .17, p \\x02 .020) were also significant\\npredictors, indicating that caregivers who were less neurotic and\\nless conscientious had higher vitality over time. The total within-\\nvariance accounted for by this model was 21.4%.\\nIn order to examine whether any of the statistically significant\\nfixed effects in the first HLM interacted with time in the prediction\\nof the caregivers’ vitality trajectories, we ran a follow-up HLM. In\\nthis model, neuroticism and conscientiousness, along with time\\nand the interaction terms between time and each variable, were\\nadded. None of the interaction terms were statistically significant\\nin the HLM (all ps \\x02 .278), suggesting that the slopes of caregiv-\\ners’ vitality trajectories did not differ as a function of either\\nneuroticism or conscientiousness.\\nSocial Functioning\\nIn the second HLM, with social functioning as the dependent\\nvariable, time was statistically significant (b \\x02 7.66, SE \\x02 1.07,\\np \\x05 .001), such that across the five time points social functioning\\nimproved. Neuroticism (b \\x02 \\x06.34, SE \\x02 .15, p \\x02 .032) and\\nconscientiousness (b \\x02 \\x06.52, SE \\x02 .21, p \\x02 .016) were also\\nsignificant predictors, such that participants who were less neurotic\\nand less conscientious had greater social functioning over time.\\nAgreeableness also statistically predicted social functioning (b \\x02\\n.50, SE \\x02 .21, p \\x02 .021), indicating that caregivers who were more\\nagreeable had greater social functioning over time. The within-\\nvariance accounted for by this model was 24.7%.\\nAs before, a follow-up HLM was run in which the fixed effects\\nwere neuroticism, conscientiousness, and agreeableness, along\\nwith time and the interaction terms between time and each of these\\nvariables. None of the interaction terms was statistically significant\\n(all ps \\x02 .103).\\nRole Limitations–Emotional\\nIn the third HLM, with role limitations–emotional as the de-\\npendent variable, time was the only statistically significant predic-\\ntor (b \\x02 10.38, SE \\x02 1.69, p \\x05 .001), such that role limitations due\\nto emotional functioning improved across the five time points. All\\nNEO predictors were nonsignificant (all ps \\x02 .067). The within-\\nvariance accounted for by this model was 20.1%.\\nMental Health\\nIn the fourth HLM, with mental health as the dependent vari-\\nable, time was significant (b \\x02 11.09, SE \\x02 .87, p \\x05 .001), such\\nthat mental health scores improved over time. Neuroticism\\n(b \\x02 \\x06.37, SE \\x02 .09, p \\x05 .001) and conscientiousness (b \\x02 \\x06.36,\\nSE \\x02 .13, p \\x02 .007) were also significant predictors, indicating\\nthat less neurotic and less conscientious caregivers had better\\nmental health over time. The within-variance accounted for was\\n50.5% in this model.\\nA follow-up HLM was run in which the fixed effects were\\nneuroticism and conscientiousness, along with time and the inter-\\naction terms between time and each of these variables.

Neu-\\nroticism was also statistically significant (b \\x02 .11, SE \\x02 .05, p \\x02\\n.034), such that participants who were more neurotic had greater\\nlevels of anxiety over time. All other predictors were nonsignifi-\\ncant (all ps \\x07 .465). The explained within-variance accounted for\\nby this model was 19.4%.\\nAs before, a follow-up HLM was performed with neuroticism as\\nthe fixed effect, along with time and the interaction of both\\nvariables The interaction of time with neuroticism was statistically\\nsignificant (b \\x02 .07, SE \\x02 .02, p \\x05 .001), suggesting that although\\nall individuals decreased in anxiety over time, there was a larger\\ndecline in symptoms of anxiety among caregivers with low levels\\nof neuroticism (see Figure 1).

The\\nwithin-variance accounted for by this model was 14.1%.\\nSimilar to the case in prior analyses, a follow-up HLM was\\nconducted with neuroticism and time as the fixed effects, along\\nwith the interaction term of the two. The interaction term was\\nstatistically significant (b \\x02 .04, SE \\x02 .02, p \\x02 .014), suggesting\\nthat depression improved at a quicker rate over time in caregivers\\nwith low levels of neuroticism than in those with high neuroticism\\n(see Figure 2).\\nDiscussion\\nThe purpose of the current study was to construct linear growth\\nmodels to examine whether personality traits of Danish caregivers\\nof persons with severe brain injury were predictive of caregivers’\\ntrajectories of mental HRQoL, anxiety, and depression beginning\\nat patients’ stay in a neurointensive care unit through 1 year after\\ninjury. All four HRQoL, anxiety, and depression variables im-\\nproved significantly across the five time points. Caregivers who\\nwere less neurotic and less conscientious tended to have higher\\nscores on measures of vitality, social functioning, and mental\\nhealth over time. Additionally, caregivers with higher agreeable-\\nness had higher social functioning. Although the overall sample\\nexperienced a decrease in anxiety and depression over time, care-\\ngivers with low neuroticism decreased more quickly in both de-\\npression and anxiety.\\nMost research on caregivers within the field of TBI has inves-\\ntigated how patients’ different characteristics predict caregivers’\\nemotional state (Anderson et al., 2009; Brooks et al., 1987; Pons-\\nford et al., 2003; Ponsford & Schönberger, 2010), but no research\\nhas investigated how caregivers’ personality traits are associated\\nwith psychological adjustment to their family member’s condition.\\nRelated research has been performed on coping styles (Calvete &\\nde Arroyabe, 2012; Carnes & Quinn, 2005; Norup, Siert, &\\nMortensen, 2013) and resilience (Simpson & Jones, 2013) in\\ncaregivers, where both constructs have been found to correlate\\npositively with positive affect (Simpson & Jones, 2013) and\\nHRQoL (Norup, Siert, et al., 2013) and negatively with burden\\n(Simpson & Jones, 2013). However, no study has investigated\\npersonality traits in TBI caregivers, especially in terms of their\\nlongitudinal associations, and thus the results of the current study\\nare novel. Nevertheless, these findings are comparable to research\\nfocused on other neurological conditions such as dementia and\\nstroke. Within the field of dementia research, Markiewicz and\\ncolleagues (1997) reported that caregivers with higher neuroticism\\nexperience more burden and distress, and in concordance with this\\nfinding, Gallant and Connell (2003) found that dementia caregiv-\\ners with high neuroticism showed more negative emotional states\\nand depression. Melo, Maroco, and de Mendonça (2011) also\\nfound that high neuroticism was a strong predictor of depression in\\ndementia caregiver, and that, in contrast, extraversion and agree-\\nableness were associated with decreases in both caregiver depres-\\nsion and burden. A similar finding was reported in stroke research,\\nwhere caregivers with high neuroticism reported higher levels of\\nFigure 1.\\nTrajectories of anxiety by caregiver neuroticism.

The literature well describes\\nhow being a caregiver is a time-consuming and physically and\\nmentally draining task, and it is therefore easily imaginable how\\nan irritable and hostile caregiver can find it hard to adapt to a\\nchronically stressful situation. Caregivers high in neuroticism\\nmay also be prone to worry and dwell on what might go wrong\\n(McCrae & Costa, 2003) instead of trying to deal with a\\ndistressing and demanding situation. In light of the current\\nfindings, neuroticism does seem to be related to how caregivers\\ncope with the demands of brain injury and their own negative\\nemotions. Caregivers high in neuroticism may be at risk of\\nsocial isolation and depression over time, even as rehabilitation\\nends and patient impairments become more chronic.\\nThe study also found that caregivers who were less consci-\\nentious tended to have higher levels of vitality, social function-\\ning, and mental health over time. The personality trait of\\nconscientiousness is defined by planfulness, organization, and\\ndiligence, which theoretically could protect the caregivers from\\nfeeling overwhelmed and burdened. One reason for this con-\\ntrasting finding may be that caregivers who are more consci-\\nentious might feel helpless and a lack of control at the begin-\\nning of the recovery process, especially if they thrive best with\\norder and planning. Many issues related to the patient are not in\\nthe hands of caregivers in the early stages of recovery. Conse-\\nquently, highly conscientious caregivers may be anxious in\\nanticipation of how to care for the individual with TBI early in\\nthe recovery process extending into the first year postinjury,\\nwhich may lead to poorer well-being.\\nDespite the novelty of the current findings in the context of\\nbrain injury, they are comparable with results from other fields in\\nneurology, with certain personality traits being robust predictors of\\ncaregiver outcomes. An important point to consider may be that\\ndifferent personality traits could be more important in different\\ntime periods. In the early stages of recovery from the event,\\ncharacteristics related to the patients’ condition are important\\n(Anderson et al., 2009; Brooks et al., 1987; Norup et al., 2012);\\nhowever, these associations might disappear with time, suggesting\\nthat personality traits of caregivers might be especially important\\nlater in recovery. Nonetheless, it is important not to view person-\\nality traits as an obstacle to providing interventions to families\\ndealing with brain injury. The results of this study underscore the\\nnecessity of assessing caregiver personality in an effort to tailor\\nfamily interventions. Consequently, future intervention programs\\nwill benefit from including brief personality measures and possibly\\nan assessment of coping strategies or caregiver style in order to\\nstrengthen the adaptation process of caregivers and the rest of the\\nfamily.\\nStudy Limitations\\nLimitations of this study must be considered when interpreting\\nthe results. The study included caregivers of patients with TBI and\\nNTBI because both patient groups were treated and received\\nrehabilitation in the clinical ward. However, no group differences\\nwere found in relation to the six different outcome variables, and\\nconsequently data were treated as being homogenous. The single-\\ncenter design is also a limitation, which warrants caution with\\nrespect to generalizing the results. However, because the Clinic of\\nNeurorehabilitation, Traumatic Brain Injury Unit covers the east-\\nern part of Denmark, that fact does expand the representativeness\\nof the sample. Data on caregiver self-reported physical health,\\nwhich may have had an effect on caregiver mental health and\\npersonality, were not assessed at each time point; this would be a\\nripe area for future research. Additionally, the limited sample size\\nmay have affected the power of the analyses and the accuracy of\\nthe parameter estimates. Results should therefore be interpreted\\nwith an appropriate degree of caution. Finally, caregivers’ person-\\nFigure 2.\\nTrajectories of depression by caregiver neuroticism.

The personality of the caregiver can be\\nviewed as a resource and could be assessed and incorporated when\\nproviding interventions. So far, limited research has been con-\\nducted on different caregiver intervention programs within the\\nfield of ABI.

Such programs should\\nattempt to hone more adaptive coping strategies in caregivers,\\nwhich might enhance caregiver outcomes.',\n",
       " 'Introduction\\nFamilies of critically ill adult patients with severe acute\\nbrain injury have to make difficult decisions regarding\\nICU care because their loved ones are nearly always\\n*Correspondence: david.hwang@yale.edu\\n†Urs Weber, Qiang Zhang have contributed equally to this work.\\n2 Yale New Haven Hospital, New Haven, CT, USA\\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\\n715\\nincapacitated and are often faced with challenging\\nprognoses regarding functional outcome [1, 2]. Meet-\\ning the decision support needs of these families is a\\nprofessional and moral duty of any ICU, whether a\\ndedicated neuroscience ICU (neuro-ICU) or a gen-\\neral critical care unit [2, 3]. However, studies of family\\nperception of support during shared decision-making\\nin ICUs show significant room for involvement [4, 5].\\nOnly 41% of family members in one prominent general\\nmulticenter ICU study reported excellent overall satis-\\nfaction with decision-making [4].\\nUnderstanding patient and family factors associated\\nwith family dissatisfaction with ICU shared decision-\\nmaking support may help identify high-risk families\\nand provide insight into high-yield strategies for effec-\\ntive future interventions [6, 7]. In the general critical\\ncare literature, several well-designed randomized tri-\\nals of interventions aimed at improving ICU decision-\\nmaking support—with broad inclusion criteria for\\nenrolling families—have shown that demonstrating the\\nimpact of any intervention can be challenging, regard-\\nless of selected outcomes [8–10].\\nAlthough specific predictors of family dissatisfac-\\ntion with critical care in general have been previously\\nreported (e.g., living in the same city as the hospital,\\nliving in a different household than the patient) [7, 11],\\nstudies of factors that specifically predict family dis-\\nsatisfaction with decision-making support for neuro-\\ncritically ill patients have been relatively limited [5, 12].\\nIdentifying risk factors associated with dissatisfaction\\nwith shared decision-making for families of neurocriti-\\ncal care patients is critical to optimally assist them with\\nmaking challenging decisions on behalf of their loved\\nones. Here we tested whether there are distinct patient-\\nlevel and family-level characteristics that predict dissat-\\nisfaction with support during neurocritical care shared\\ndecision-making, with hopes that results could guide\\nfuture high-yield initiatives to improve family satisfac-\\ntion with decision support.\\nMethods\\nStudy Design, Including Ethics Statement\\nWe conducted a retrospective observational cohort\\nstudy using a combined database of Family Satisfaction\\nin the ICU 24 (FS-ICU 24) surveys collected from the\\nneuro-ICUs at two US academic medical centers over\\nthe past decade [5, 13]. The institutional review boards\\nof both medical centers separately approved the origi-\\nnal collection of survey data and patient and family\\ninformation. Analyses for this study were performed\\nwith deidentified patient and family data.\\nDatabase Descriptions\\nThe Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) neuro-\\nICU FS-ICU 24 database contains data from 76 family\\nmembers that were collected from July to August 2011.\\nFamilies of all patients admitted to the neuro-ICU\\nwith a minimum ICU length of stay (LOS) of 24 h were\\napproached in person at the time of or up to 48 h after\\nICU discharge or transfer and asked to complete paper\\nsurveys. One family member per patient was recruited,\\nwith a focus on health care proxies. Minors, non-Eng-\\nlish speakers, and all families of patients who received\\ncomfort measures only (CMO) were excluded. The cap-\\nture rate of eligible participants in this database has\\nbeen previously reported as 63% [5].\\nThe Yale New Haven Hospital (hereinafter “Yale”)\\nneuro-ICU FS-ICU 24 database contains data from\\n288 family members that were collected from March\\nto December 2015. Families of patients admitted to the\\nneuro-ICU for longer than 72 h were eligible, with one\\nfamily member per patient recruited. Minors and non-\\nEnglish speakers were excluded. Families of patients\\nwho did not receive CMO were approached in person at\\nthe time of or up to 48 h after ICU discharge or trans-\\nfer, whereas families of patients who received CMO were\\ncontacted by mail 1 month after ICU discharge to respect\\nthe time to cope with a loved one’s death and minimize\\nrecall bias [14]. In-house surveys were conducted via\\nan online form, and mailed surveys were completed on\\npaper. The capture rate of eligible participants in this\\ndatabase has been previously reported as 49.3% (51.9%\\nfor families of patients who did not receive CMO and\\n40.4% for families of patients who did receive CMO) [13].\\nSettings\\nBoth the MGH and Yale neuro-ICUs operate as closed-\\ncollaborative units. For neurology patients, intensivists\\nare the primary attendings of record. For neurosurgical\\npatients, neurosurgeons remain the primary attendings\\nof record, but intensivists see all patients in the unit and\\nare responsible for all orders and day-to-day manage-\\nment. Family meetings are also scheduled on an ad hoc\\nbasis to provide updates and discuss management of\\ncare. Some of the meetings are informal, and others are\\nmore formal, with representatives from multiple services,\\nincluding nursing, social work, and case management.\\nIn both neuro-ICUs, multidisciplinary morning rounds\\nare led by the attending intensivist at the patient’s bedside\\nand include all patients within the unit. Prior to the coro-\\nnavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, when the\\ndata for our study was conducted, families were invited\\nto participate actively in these morning rounds.\\n716\\nVariables\\nWe divided covariates into three categories: (1) fam-\\nily characteristics at the time of hospital admission, (2)\\npatient characteristics at the time of hospital admission,\\nand (3) patient and family factors determined during the\\nICU course. Family covariates in both databases were\\ncaptured directly from surveys, whereas patient covari-\\nates were abstracted from medical records.\\nFamily characteristics at the time of hospital admis-\\nsion included age, sex, race, level of education, English\\nas a first language, relationship with patient, prior ICU\\nexperience, health care proxy status (self-identified), and\\nsize of family. Information regarding whether the family\\nmember lived with the patient and whether the family\\nmember lived in the same town as the hospital was also\\nobtained. The demographic questions for the family sur-\\nvey at both sites, including those with multiple-choice\\nanswers, are listed in Supplementary Digital Content 1.\\nCollected patient characteristics at the time of hospital\\nadmission included age, sex, race, and primary diagnosis.\\nPatient and family factors determined during the ICU\\ncourse included average hours per day spent by the fam-\\nily at bedside, number of formal family meetings the\\nfamily reported participating in during the ICU admis-\\nsion (definition of “formal family meeting” was left to the\\njudgment of the survey respondent), decision made by\\nthe family to limit code status (limitation defined as do\\nnot resuscitate, do not intubate, do not resuscitate/do not\\nintubate, or CMO), patient LOS, and patient modified\\nRankin Scale at the time of discharge from the ICU. We\\nincluded the modified Rankin Scale at discharge because\\nwe were concerned over the possibility that a patient’s\\nfinal functional outcome could be associated with the\\noutcome of interest.\\nOutcome\\nThe primary outcome was family dissatisfaction with\\nitem eight on the “Satisfaction with Decision-Making”\\nsection of the FS-ICU 24 questionnaire. The FS-ICU 24\\nsurvey has been extensively validated and used to study\\nfamily satisfaction in the ICU setting around the world\\n[4, 6, 13, 15–21]. It is a 24-item survey consisting of two\\nsubsections: “Satisfaction With Care” (14 items) and\\n“Satisfaction With Decision-Making” (10 items). Items\\nfrom the latter subsection have been used extensively in\\nstudies measuring satisfaction with ICU decision-mak-\\ning [6, 22, 23]. Item eight of the decision-making section\\nreads, “Did you feel supported during the decision-mak-\\ning process?” and prompts respondents to indicate their\\nsatisfaction with the support provided on a Likert scale\\n(five-point ranking scale; Supplementary Digital Con-\\ntent 2). We selected this single item as our outcome of\\ninterest as opposed to a composite score of the decision-\\nmaking subsection of the questionnaire because this\\nsubsection itself has a wide variety of questions, each of\\nwhich may be influenced by different sets of covariates\\nin clinical practice. For this study, we defined dissatisfac-\\ntion with decision-making support as less than complete\\nsatisfaction on this particular survey item, including all\\nthe options other than the top-box response. We chose\\nthis approach to mirror that way in which the Centers for\\nMedicare and Medicaid Services report patient satisfac-\\ntion data [7].\\nStatistical Analysis\\nWe analyzed the covariates of dissatisfied and completely\\nsatisfied families and their corresponding patients using\\nstandard descriptive statistics and collapsed several levels\\nof variables included in the original questionnaires on the\\nbasis of the relatively smaller percentages of responses\\nreceived for certain levels. We then compared family and\\npatient covariates between dissatisfied and completely\\nsatisfied families using the χ2 test for categorical variables\\nand the Mann–Whitney U test for continuous variables.\\nWe then performed a multivariate logistic regression\\nanalysis to identify independent predictors of decision-\\nmaking support dissatisfaction among all family covari-\\nates and among family and patient covariates combined.\\nIBM SPSS Statistics 26 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY) was\\nused for the analysis. Missing data were excluded [24].\\nResults\\nSubjects Selected from Databases\\nOn the basis of those participants in the data sets who\\nhad responses recorded for FS-ICU 24 item eight (“Did\\nyou feel supported during the decision-making pro-\\ncess?”), we included 73 of the 76 respondents in the exist-\\ning MGH database and 282 of the 288 respondents in\\nthe existing Yale database (355 of 364 total respondents).\\nThe overall characteristics of patients and families in the\\nMGH and Yale data sets have been reported in prior pub-\\nlications [5, 13]. We found that 50.7% (180 of 355) of all\\nsurvey respondents indicated dissatisfaction with sup-\\nport during decision-making: 56.1% (41 of 73) at MGH\\nand 49.3% (139 of 282) at Yale (p\\u2009=\\u20090.30).\\nFamily Characteristics at the Time of ICU Admission\\nOverall, family survey respondents included in the anal-\\nysis were predominantly White (291 of 337 completed\\nquestion responses [86.4%]) and received a college edu-\\ncation or higher (245 of 339 [72.3%]). The majority had\\nprior ICU experience (197 of 352 [56.0%]).\\nTable 1 reports a univariate comparison of family\\ncharacteristics ascertainable at the time of ICU admis-\\nsion between those who were dissatisfied with shared\\n717\\ndecision-making support and those who were completely\\nsatisfied. The cohort of family respondents who were\\ndissatisfied had smaller-sized families (e.g., “Size of fam-\\nily visiting patient regularly in ICU\\u2009>\\u20096 people,” 14.5% vs.\\n24.3%; p\\u2009=\\u20090.03). Other covariates did not significantly\\ndiffer between dissatisfied and completely satisfied family\\nmembers.\\nPatient Characteristics at the Time of ICU Admission\\nThe majority of patients whose families were included\\nin the analysis were admitted with nontraumatic suba-\\nrachnoid hemorrhage (21.1%), intraparenchymal and/or\\nintraventricular brain hemorrhage (18.9%), or ischemic\\nstroke (18.0%). Table 2 reports a univariate comparison\\nof patient characteristics ascertainable at the time of ICU\\nadmission between those who had family members who\\nwere dissatisfied with decision-making support and those\\nwho had family members who were completely satisfied.\\nThere were no significant differences in the recorded\\npatient characteristics between those whose family mem-\\nbers were dissatisfied and those whose family members\\nwere satisfied.\\nPatient and Family Factors Determined During the ICU\\nCourse\\nOverall, the majority of family respondents included in\\nthe analysis reported spending more than 3 h a day at\\nthe patient’s bedside (272 of 341 [79.8%]). We found that\\n18.9% (67 of 354) of families made a decision to limit\\npatient code status during the ICU admission; among\\nthe Yale surrogates, 16.7% (47 of 282) requested CMO\\nfor their relatives. The average LOS for patients was 8.6\\n(standard deviation 8.4) days, and 32.1% (113 of 352) of\\npatients were bedridden or dead at the time of discharge.\\nTable 3 reports univariate comparisons of both family\\nand patient factors determined during the ICU course\\nbetween dissatisfied and completely satisfied families.\\nA higher proportion of dissatisfied families reported\\nTable\\u202f1\\u2002 Univariate comparison of family characteristics at the time of ICU admission\\nAll categorical variables are reported as n (%).

There\\nwas also a trend toward a family’s decision to keep a\\npatient as full code, without treatment limitations, being\\npredictive of dissatisfaction (odds ratio 1.80 [confidence\\ninterval 0.93–3.51]; p\\u2009=\\u20090.08).

A retrospective analysis of survey\\nresponses from 457 family members of patients admit-\\nted to general ICUs in two hospitals did previously report\\nthat participating in at least one family meeting predicted\\nsatisfaction with overall decision-making processes (i.e.,\\nthe composite score of ten items related to decision-mak-\\ning on the FS-ICU 24 survey) [26]. Approximately 60% of\\npatients in this analysis had an ICU LOS of less than 4\\nfull days. Our data suggest that in neurocritical care envi-\\nronments, for those patients with longer LOS on average,\\nthe actual frequency of formal family meetings may be\\ncritical, specifically regarding the satisfaction with sup-\\nport provided during shared decision-making (i.e., a spe-\\ncific single item within the FS-ICU 24 survey). Another\\nrecent study of 48 surrogates of patients with nontrau-\\nmatic intracerebral hemorrhage examined predictors of\\nhigher family satisfaction with overall ICU decision-mak-\\ning (i.e., again, the ten-item composite FS-ICU 24 deci-\\nsion-making subscore) and concluded that among other\\nfactors, younger patient age and the respondent being the\\nspouse of the patient were independent predictive factors\\n[12]. Our larger cohort of patients with a wider array of\\nneurocritical care diagnoses did not replicate these find-\\nings, but, again, our study used a single specific FS-ICU\\n24 item regarding support provided during shared deci-\\nsion-making as the outcome of interest.\\nThe finding in our study that a higher proportion of\\neuro-ICU families who chose to keep patients full code\\ntrended toward reporting dissatisfaction with decisional\\nsupport compared with those who decided on treatment\\nlimitations does complement prior general critical care\\nfamily satisfaction literature [27, 28]. Family members\\nwhose loved ones passed away during ICU admission\\nreport higher levels of overall satisfaction with ICU care\\nthan those whose loved ones survived [27]. Although\\nour study cannot prove causation, we speculate that this\\ncorrelation could be in part a by-product of increased\\namount of attention devoted to families of patients given\\ndo-not-intubate/do-not-resuscitate orders or CMO.\\nThis study had limitations. Nonresponse bias is a con-\\ncern for survey studies; to minimize this bias, we drew\\ndata from two previously published data sets with good\\nresponse rates for survey research [5, 13]. The response\\nrates for these previous data sets were achieved by\\nattempting to survey families in person while patients\\nwere still admitted to the hospital and calling those fami-\\nlies who received mailed surveys to make them more\\naware of the survey request. Also, there were differences\\nin participant inclusion/exclusion criteria between the\\ntwo data sets that were combined, including the exclusion\\nof families of patients who received CMO at MGH.\\nRegarding concerns of differences in response rates and\\ninclusion/exclusion at our two centers, we note that the\\npercentage of families reporting they were dissatisfied\\nwith decision-making was similar in each cohort.\\nWe did not capture family levels of psychological dis-\\ntress and coping resources as predictor variables. The\\nphrase “formal family meeting” was not explicitly defined\\nand could therefore have been interpreted differently by\\ndifferent respondents. Additionally, we did not include\\ninitial disease-specific severity scores or data regarding\\nurgent procedures for patients because of the heteroge-\\nneity of our patient population; however, we did not find\\nany differences in dissatisfaction among families with\\nrespect to patient functional outcome at the time of ICU\\ndischarge. The databases that we used did not include\\ninformation about whether individual patients were inca-\\npacitated during their neuro-ICU admissions or not, rais-\\ning the question of whether their surrogates were actually\\nrequired to make critical decisions on their behalf while\\nthey were admitted. Of note, although we recognize the\\nheterogeneous makeup of neuro-ICU populations in dif-\\nferent settings, prior literature does suggest high rates of\\npatients who lack capacity in ICUs in general [29].\\nFor our outcome, we used a single item on an older ver-\\nsion of the FS-ICU 24 survey. However, a newly revised\\nversion has now been recently developed [30]. The exact\\nwording of the question regarding decision-making sup-\\nport that we used as our outcome of interest is slightly\\ndifferent in the newest version of the FS-ICU 24 sur-\\nvey; in the newest version, respondents are now asked\\nif they felt “unsupported,” as opposed to “overwhelmed.”\\nIt is possible that repeating the study with the new FS-\\nICU 24 item wording could lead to different results. The\\ndecision to dichotomize our selected survey question’s\\nLikert responses into “completely satisfied” and “less sat-\\nisfied,” as opposed to considering each individual level\\nof satisfaction, was made to make the data more read-\\nily interpretable. Although this approach risks missing\\nsome more nuanced differences within the “less satis-\\nfied” group, as noted earlier, it closely mirrors the stand-\\nard way in which the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid\\nServices report patient satisfaction data [7].\\nOf note, the databases we used do not include specific\\ndata on the exact decisions that families were asked to\\nmake during patient admissions (e.g., consent for surgery,\\ngoals of care, etc.), nor do they quantify the number of\\ndecisions made during each admission. Although we did\\nnot collect this detailed information, the “Satisfaction\\nWith Decision-Making” subsection of the FS-ICU 24\\nsurvey is validated as a tool to measure families’ overall\\nimpressions with aspects of decision-making in the ICU\\nat or following the time of ICU discharge, as opposed to\\n721\\nimmediately after individual moments during an ICU\\nadmission.\\nAlthough our intention in this study was to focus on\\nperceptions of decision-making support among surro-\\ngates of neuro-critically ill patients—given the difficult\\ndecisions that many of these surrogates have to grap-\\nple with when their incapacitated relatives are projected\\nto have long-term disability—the fact that this study\\nrecruited only in neuro-ICUs may limit its generalizabil-\\nity to other areas of critical care. Additionally, findings\\nfrom a pre-COVID-19 database may be difficult to gen-\\neralize to an era with visitor restriction policies [31, 32].\\nConclusions\\nWe found that family dissatisfaction with neuro-ICU\\nshared decision-making support was not correlated with\\nany patient or family characteristics ascertainable on ICU\\nadmission. However, among our cohort with an average\\nLOS of 8.6 days, family dissatisfaction correlated with\\nparticipating in three or fewer formal family meetings\\nduring ICU admission, and there was a nonsignificant\\ntrend of higher dissatisfaction levels among families of\\npatients who were kept full code.\\nDesigning interventions that improve the decision-\\nmaking experience of ICU families has proven to be\\na challenging task [8–10]. To optimize future trials of\\ninterventions for improving decisional support among\\nneuro-ICU families, understanding factors that may be\\npredictive of family dissatisfaction with support could,\\nin theory, be important for study design and participant\\nselection. However, our study suggests that such studies\\nshould cast a broad net regarding surrogates of patients\\nwith brain injury who are selected for study enrollment\\nbecause we were unable to identify reliable covariate pre-\\ndictors of dissatisfaction with decision-making support.\\nOur study does support the idea that, when designing\\nneuro-ICU interventions to improve families’ perception\\nof decision-making support, those strategies that pro-\\nmote a family’s perception of a high frequency of fam-\\nily meetings during the ICU admission may have a solid\\ntheoretical foundation. However, in the COVID-19 era\\nof strict visitor restrictions, whether an association exists\\nbetween frequent virtual meetings over the phone or\\nvia video-conferencing technology and family satisfac-\\ntion with decision-making support is an open question.\\nAs visitor restrictions remain in place, neurocritical care\\nphysicians must work to adapt to meet family communi-\\ncation needs in new, creative ways [31].\\nSupplementary Information\\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at https://\\u200bdoi.\\u200b\\norg/\\u200b10.\\u200b1007/\\u200bs12028-\\u200b021-\\u200b01211-6.\\nAuthor details\\n1 Yale School of Medicine, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA. 2 Yale New\\nHaven Hospital, New Haven, CT, USA. 3 Donald and Barbara Zucker School\\nof Medicine At Hofstra/Northwell, Long Island, NY, USA. 4 Hill Country Health\\nand Wellness Center, Round Mountain, CA, USA. 5 Department of Emergency\\nMedicine, Yale School of Medicine, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA.\\n6 School of Nursing and Health Studies, Fairfield University, Fairfield, CT, USA.\\n7 Harvard Medical School, Harvard University, Boston, MA, USA. 8 Division\\nof Neurocritical Care and the Henry and Allison McCance Center for Brain\\nHealth, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA. 9 Integrated Brain\\nHealth Clinical and Research Program, Department of Psychiatry, Massa‑\\nchusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA. 10 Division of Neurocritical Care\\nand Emergency Neurology, Department of Neurology, Yale School of Medi‑\\ncine, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA. 11 Center for Neuroepidemiology\\nand Clinical Neurological Research, Yale School of Medicine, Yale University,\\nNew Haven, CT, USA.\\nAuthor contributions\\nDYH and JR conceived the study idea and methods, with consultation from\\nAMV.

       "[\"Introduction Background Stroke is a highly prevalent public health concern, and the leading cause of death and disability among adults in developed countries . In the USA alone, stroke has an annual incidence of approximately 795,000, and is associated with an estimated 34 billion dollar cost from health care services, medications, and missed days of work . A stroke is often a devastating life-altering event for both patients and their family/friend caregivers [3–5]. Stroke occurs without warning and may result not only in death or profound disability but also substantial emotional trauma for both patients and caregivers . Although advances in endovascular and neurocritical care approaches to stroke treatment and recovery have substantially increase the number of survivors, there remains a need to develop treatments to address the emotional sequelae associated with the stroke and subsequent hospitalization for both patients and their informal caregivers. Rates of clinically significant symptoms of depression and anxiety (30–72% patients; 55–68% caregivers), as well as post-traumatic stress (PTS; 29.6% patients; 20% caregivers) are high [7–16] at hospitalization for an acute brain injury (including a stroke) and predictive of chronic emotional distress at 3and 6-months later for both patient and caregiver [8– 10]. However, there are no evidence-based psychosocial interventions focused on prevention of chronic emotional distress in this population. Emerging cross-sectional and prospective research, including our own, has shown that patient and caregiver psychosocial factors influence each other and shape each person’s recovery trajectory after a brain injury (such as a stroke), including outcomes of PTS, anxiety, and depression [17–19]. Poor patient mental health is not only directly associated with poor physical recovery but also translates in greater caregiving burden, which negatively impacts caregivers’ mental health . In turn, caregivers’ poorer mental health lowers the quality of care to the patients , which impacts patients' physical and mental health . This interdependence between patient and caregiver factors requires consideration of the dyad (e.g., pair of patient and caregiver) in order to fully capture an individual’s level of mental health risk following a stroke. Dyadic interventions that account for the interdependence between patient and caregiver factors across the recovery trajectory may be the most effective and efficient way to address emotional distress in this high-risk population. This contention is supported by two recent systematic reviews from the American Heart Association  which included available psychosocial interventions for stroke patients and caregivers. These reviews highlighted substantial limitations of current interventions for stroke patient and/or caregivers, such as an emphasis on treatment rather than on prevention of emotional distress, a focus on improving either patient or caregiver factors without accounting for their interdependence, and a lack of modular and tailored interventions to account for the heterogeneity of stroke patients' and caregivers' unique challenges and concerns. These systematic reviews recommended the development of dyadic (i.e., both patient and caregiver together) interventions that are tailored to the unique needs of Bannon et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies (2020) 6:75 Page 2 of 16 heterogeneous stroke patients and caregivers and aimed at preventing chronic emotional distress in both members of the dyad. Dyadic interventions are also more economical both in terms of interventionist time, as well as overall treatment cost [26–29]. In line with these recommendations, we used a mixedmethods approach to develop Recovering Together (RT)—the first dyadic intervention aimed at preventing chronic emotional distress in at-risk stroke dyads. First, we conducted cross-sectional and prospective studies with patients and their primary caregivers at hospitalization in a Neuroscience Intensive Care Unit (Neuro-ICU) and identified key modifiable intervention targets associated with emotional distress (e.g., mindfulness, coping, interpersonal bond, and self-efficacy) [7– 10, 16]. Next, we conducted 24 qualitative interviews with stroke dyads followed by three focus groups with nurses  to determine dyads’ challenges associated with the stroke and subsequent hospitalization, perceptions of the proposed intervention targets, ways to best teach the proposed resiliency skills, interest in the intervention, and best modality for intervention delivery. We subsequently treated one stroke dyad with Recovering Together  and made refinements from lessons learned. In the present study, we report on a feasibility randomized control trial (RCT) of RT versus a minimally enhanced usual care (MEUC) control group, which followed recommendations for rigorous feasibility testing . The study had two primary aims. First, we measured feasibility and acceptability markers (primary outcomes), including (1) ability to recruit dyads, (2) ability to retain dyads, (3) acceptability of randomization, (4) credibility, and (5) satisfaction. Second, we assessed the signals of within group improvement (baseline to posttest to 3 months follow-up) in emotional distress (e.g., symptoms of depression, anxiety and PTS) and intervention targets (mindfulness, coping, interpersonal bond, and self-efficacy) for patients and caregivers (secondary outcomes) randomized to RT and for those randomized to MEUC. Methods Design The current feasibility study was part of a sequential framework for intervention development . Our larger goal was to prepare for a future hybrid efficacyeffectiveness study testing RT’s effect in order to scale, implement, and disseminate this intervention to other Neuro-ICUs in diverse geographical regions across the USA and beyond. This feasibility RCT was conducted in the Neuro-ICU at a major urban medical teaching hospital. We compared the novel RT intervention to a MEUC condition (educational pamphlet). Simple randomization was performed using a random number generator to maintain balance between the groups during random assignment. Participants were not blinded to intervention versus the control. Participants completed questionnaires in person (i.e., during inpatient admission, with staff assistance, as needed) at baseline and either electronically through a link emailed directly to patients and caregivers via the secure web-based data collection platform REDCap  or over the phone, at post-test [~ 6 weeks after baseline] and 3-month followup. The trial was designed to address specific objectives relating to study design and methodology for the subsequent hybrid efficacy-effectiveness trial and was not designed to determine efficacy . There were no important changes to methods (e.g., eligibility criteria) after the trial commenced. Our Institutional Review Board approved all study procedures prior to study inception. Recovering Together intervention Recovering Together (RT) is a six-session, seven-module (two universal and five specific), skills-based dyadic intervention targeting the prevention of chronic emotional distress in patients and their informal caregivers. RT is informed by elements of traditional cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT; e.g., cognitive restructuring/reappraisals, adaptive thinking), dialectical behavior therapy (DBT; e.g., mindfulness, dialectics, distress tolerance), and principles from trauma-informed care (e.g., impact of the illness/injury, understanding triggers, role and identity changes, meaning making), to address unique needs experienced by each dyads . The intervention directly targets self-efficacy, mindfulness, coping skills, and intimate bonds within dyads, consistent with our prior quantitative and qualitative research . The first two sessions are delivered to all dyads, are conducted with both the patient and caregiver at bedside, and teach the core skills of mindfulness, dialectics, diaphragmatic breathing, and self-care. The following four sessions take place after the patient’s discharge via a secure video platform (i.e., Vidyo software). The patient and caregiver collaborate with the clinician to identify four out of the five available modules that best align with the dyad’s presentation and needs. These sessions build upon and rehearse skills learned in the first two sessions, and teach additional skills and topics selected by dyads . All sessions are approximately 20– 30 min and modules can be delivered in any order deemed appropriate/relevant. Table 1 provides session titles and a description of the treatment components. Minimally enhanced usual care control Dyads assigned to the minimally enhanced usual care (MEUC) condition received a three page informational Bannon et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies (2020) 6:75 Page 3 of 16 pamphlet on the stroke experience and post-stroke recovery for patients and their informal caregivers. Patient-specific information in this pamphlet included types of events defined as strokes, common symptoms after stroke (e.g., fatigue, changes in eat and sleep, changes in thinking, etc.), and suggestions for coping with emotional challenges after stroke (e.g., get regular and physical exercise, rest when you feel fatigued, spend time with friends and family, etc.). Caregiver-specific information included self-care strategies (e.g., finding times to take breaks from caregiving, keeping balance by eating healthy, exercising, and resting, etc.), ways of seeking community support (e.g., support groups, home health aide services, respite care, etc.), and a list of local and national resources related to stroke. Both RT and MEUC were delivered in addition to usual care. Usual care in the Neuro-ICU included medical care, nurse monitoring, and specialty care services (physical, occupational, and speech-language therapists, respiratory therapy, chaplaincy). Usual care after discharge typically includes specialty care services (e.g., speech, physical therapy) as determined by the medical team. Recruitment, screening, and consent Patients were identified by study staff who checked the electronic medical record for newly admitted stroke patients. Next, study staff approached potential participants, described the study, and completed screening for eligibility. Eligible stroke patients included those (1) over age 18, (2) with demonstrated English fluency and literacy, (3) who suffered an acute stroke (hemorrhagic and ischemic) within maximum 1 week prior to recruitment, (4) who had a caregiver also willing to participate, and (5) medically and cognitively cleared for participation by the medical team. Eligible caregivers included those who: (1) were over age 18, (2) demonstrated English fluency and literacy, and (3) were the primary caregivers of a patient admitted with an acute stroke. Within each dyad, either the patient or caregiver had to screen in for clinically significant symptoms of depression, anxiety, or PTS. This criterion ensures risk for chronic emotional distress within a dyad, based on prior research [35–37]. Dyads were excluded if they were unable or unwilling to participate in in-person and video sessions, or complete follow up measures electronically or over the phone. If dyads elected to participate, study staff gave the dyad physical copies of the treatment manuals/pamphlets (condition dependent), installed the secure Virtual Visit software (i.e., Vidyo) on their electronic device, and scheduled the dyad’s first session with the clinician who subsequently scheduled all sessions with the dyad at the end of each session/module. Assessments Following the informed consent process, dyads completed self-report questionnaires in the Neuro-ICU at the time of study enrollment (baseline), assisted by study staff, as needed. They completed a similar set of questionnaires after the 6-week study period (post-test), and again 3 months after enrollment (3 month). Demographic questionnaires Patient and caregiver questionnaires assessed age, gender, race/ethnicity, employment status, marital status, educational level, and mental health history (Table 2). The Hospital Depression and Anxiety Scale (HADS)  is a widely used, reliable, and valid measure for symptoms of depression and anxiety. It has 14 items answered on a 4-point Likert scale from 0 “not at all” or Table 1 Session content for Recovering Together (RT) Sessions/(modules) Session content and skills In the Neuro-ICU, in person at bedside 1.

Pilot and Feasibility Studies (2020) 6:75 Page 5 of 16 “very rarely” to 3 “all of the time” or “very often.” Scores for depression and anxiety are calculated separately by summing the items for the respective subscales (each including seven items). Higher scores indicate higher symptom severity. Scores equivalent or greater than 8 represent clinically significant symptoms of anxiety or depression. A review of 15 studies reported average internal reliability for the HADS; internal reliability ranged from questionable to excellent for both the anxiety (HADS-A; mean α = 82; range .67 to .90) and depression (HADS-D; mean α = 83; range .68 to .93) subscales . In the current sample, internal reliability was good for patients (α = .86) and was excellent for caregivers (α = .92) for the HADS-A, and similar across time points. For the HADS-D, internal reliability was good for caregivers (α = .82) and questionable for patients (α = .66), though internal reliability improved at post-test and the 3month follow up (α = .71 and .75). Minimally important clinical differences (MCIDs) for HADS subscales are between 1.5 and 1.7 . The PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C)  is a valid and reliable measure of post-traumatic stress (PTS) symptom severity. There are 17-items scored on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 “not at all” to 5 “extremely”. Total severity scores, as well as clinically significant, are generated by summing all items. A review of 135 studies including the PCL-C indicated that the measure demonstrated excellent internal consistency across studies (α = 93) . Higher PCL-C scores suggest worse symptom severity. The PCL-C had good internal reliability for patients (α = .86) and was excellent for caregivers (α = .92) in our sample. Clinically significant symptoms are determined by following an algorithm based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM) criteria being met (B-D) with symptoms endorsement in the moderate or above range. A 10-point improvement in symptoms is considered clinically meaningful . The General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSE)  is a 10-item measure of ability to resourcefully manage challenging situations. Items are scored on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 1 “not at all true” to 4 “exactly true.” Total scores are determined by summing all items together. Higher scores depict higher perceived resourcefulness. Internal reliability was good for patients (α = .89) and for caregivers (α = .85) at baseline and similar at later Table 2 Baseline characteristics for study participants (Continued) Intervention (RT) n = 7 Control (MEUC) n = 9 Total N = 16 M(SD), range M(SD), range M(SD), range Race White 6 (85.7) 7 (77.8) 13 (81.3) Asian 1 (14.3) 1 (11.1) 2 (12.5) More than 1 race 0 (0.0) 1 (11.1) 1 (6.3) Work status Unemployed 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) Retired 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) Homemaker 1 (14.3) 0 (0.0) 1 (6.3) Employed full-time 5 (71.4) 6 (66.7) 11 (68.8) Employed part-time 1 (14.3) 0 (0.0) 1 (6.3) Other 0 (0.0) 3 (33.3) 3 (18.8) Education Less than high school (< 12) 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) High school diploma (12) 2 (28.6) 0 (0.0) 2 (12.5) Some college/ Associates 1 (14.3) 2 (22.2) 3 (18.8) 4-year college 4 (57.1) 6 (66.7) 10 (62.5) Graduate/ Professional 0 (0.0) 1 (11.1) 1 (6.3) History of psych conditions None 3 (42.9) 5 (55.6) 8 (50.0) Depression 3 (42.9) 2 (22.2) 5 (31.3) Anxiety 3 (42.9) 2 (22.2) 5 (31.3) PTSD 2 (28.6) 0 (0.0) 2 (12.5) Other 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) Bannon et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies (2020) 6:75 Page 6 of 16 time points, consistent with previous studies involving the GSE . The Measure of Current Status Part A (MOCS-A)  is a measure validated in medically-ill populations that assesses an individual’s ability to employ various coping skills, including relaxation techniques, acknowledgment of stress and tension, ability to be assertive, and altering negative thought patterns, as a responsive to daily life stressors. The 13-items are answered on a 5-point Likert scale with responses ranging from 0 “I cannot do this at all” to 4 “I can do this extremely well.” Total coping scores are generated by summing all items. Higher scores suggest more efficient coping techniques. In the current sample, internal reliability was acceptable for patients (α = .78) and excellent (α = .95 or higher) for caregivers in the sample, which is similar to the coefficients reported in published studies of NICU caregivers (α = 0.91) . The Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness ScaleRevised (CAMS)  is a valid and reliable measure of the extent to which individuals experience thoughts and feelings within the present moment. The 12-item measure is scored using a 4-point Likert scale from 1 “rarely or not at all” to 4 “almost always.” Total mindfulness scores are computed by summing all the items, with greater scores suggesting greater mindfulness. The CAMS-R demonstrates poor to good internal reliability (αs from .61 to .85) across studies . In the present sample, the CAMS-R demonstrated good reliability for caregivers (α = .86), and questionable internal reliability for patients (α = .54) at baseline, though improved to excellent at post-test and good at 3 months (α = .90 and .87). The Intimate Bond Measure (IBM)  is a measure of participants’ perception of the quality of their interaction with their caregiver or patient, specifically assessing domains of control by one’s partners and perceived care. The 24-items are scored on a 4-point Likert scale with responses from 0 “not at all true” to 3 “very true.” Items about partner’s perceived control are reverse scored and summed with the remaining care items. Higher scores suggest higher perceived care and lower partner control. Previous studies have found internal reliability coefficients that ranged from questionable to good (α from 0.68 to 0.83) . In this sample, the IBM showed poor internal reliability for patients (α = .54), though improved to questionable at post-test (α = .64) and good (α = .83) at 3 months. Internal reliability was good for caregivers (α = .85) at baseline and similar across time points. At pre-test, participants completed the Credibility and Expectancy Questionnaire (CEQ) , a 6-item measure of treatment expectancy and rationale credibility for clinical outcome studies. The measure has two subscales that demonstrate differential predictive validity among medical populations  (1) cognitively based credibility and (2) affectively based expectancy. Possible scores range from 3 to 27 for both the credibility and the expectancy subscales, with higher scores indicating higher perceived credibility/expectancy. In the validation study, the CEQ had a total standardized alpha coefficient (both factors) of .85. In the present sample, the credibility scale demonstrated excellent internal reliability for patients (α = .90) and caregivers (α = .91). The expectancy scale demonstrated good internal reliability for patients (α = .87) and acceptable reliability for caregivers (α = .74). At post-test, participants completed the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-3) , a 3-item measure of satisfaction with the program. The CSQ-3 has been used to measure psychotherapy treatment satisfaction among individuals with depression , chronic pain , and other physical conditions . Items are scored on a 4-point Likert scale, with higher scores indicating greater satisfaction with delivery of care, satisfaction with clinician, and overall program satisfaction. Internal reliability in this sample was excellent for both patients (α = .90) and for caregivers (α = .95), and similar to those reported across studies of client satisfaction . There were no changes to assessment or measurement procedures after the trial commenced. Feasibility and acceptability Feasibility of recruitment was assessed by determining the number of patients approached in the Neuro-ICU who agreed to participate (% screened/% enrolled). Acceptability of randomization and procedures was determined by measuring the number of participants who elected to discontinue after they learned their randomization status. Acceptability of study procedures was determined by the number of participants lost to follow-up (no posttest and 3-month follow-up) in both RT and MEUC. Adherence to treatment was determined based on the number of sessions attended by participants in RT condition. Dyads were considered adherent if they attended at least four out of six RT sessions. Feasibility of quantitative measures was deemed acceptable if no questionnaires were missing in full in more than 25% of participants and if reliability was higher than .70 for each questionnaire individually. Randomization and allocation concealment Participants were randomized 1:1 to RT or MEUC (simple randomization). Patient baseline materials contained sealed envelopes. Envelopes were opened by study clinicians after dyads completed the recruitment and screening process, consented to study participation, and Bannon et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies (2020) 6:75 Page 7 of 16 completed the baseline measures. Because we compared RT with a minimally enhanced control condition, neither the dyad nor the therapist was blind to condition. Identification of study limitation to inform the future trial The study principal investigator (PI) maintained a constant dialog with the study staff who collected data, the study therapists, Neuro-ICU nurses and medical staff, as well as patients and their caregivers. Bi-weekly team meetings with nursing staff were also held to discuss feasibility issues. The study team documented issues related to recruitment, retention, assessments, and intervention delivery throughout the study to identify and remedy any limitations that were not previously considered. No changes were made to session content or treatment delivery. Finally, we monitored any adverse events in both intervention groups, none of which were observed. Data analyses The current study was a feasibility trial designed to inform a hybrid efficacy-effectiveness trial ; as such, it was not designed to detect a treatment effect . Feasibility trials primarily report descriptive statistics on variables, as well as information on recruitment, acceptability of screening, randomization, and quantitative assessments. For the active treatment condition (RT), we report treatment satisfaction and perceived credibility. Data were examined withintreatment and -subject (patients and caregivers separately) in RT and MEUC. First, we present descriptive statistics (means and standard deviations) for the outcome variables at each time point. Next, we present within-subjects changes and effect sizes for improvement from baseline to post-test and from post-test to 3 months using Cohen’s d separately for patients and caregivers, and by treatment group (RT vs. control). We specify whether these improvements are above the MCIDs for depression, anxiety, and PTS. Finally, we report frequency of patients and caregivers with clinically significant symptoms of depression, anxiety, and PTS at all time points. There were no interim analyses or stopping rules for this feasibility study. Results Sample Baseline participant characteristics are presented in Table 2 for patients and caregivers, separately for the RT and MEUC. Patients were gender balanced and in majority white and educated. Conditions were comparable in terms of age and racial and ethnic distribution. Feasibility of recruitment We report the number of individuals referred for screening, approached for further screening, and consented (see Fig. 1 for a CONSORT diagram of the study). Over the course of 1 year, a total of 296 new stroke patients hospitalized in the Neuro-ICU were identified based on the medical record. Of those, 19 declined screening, 135 were discharged before they could be approached by the study team for screening, and 102 potential dyads did not meet initial screening criteria (one through five), in majority due to altered mental status. The remaining 40 dyads who met these initial criteria were further screened for emotional distress using the HADS and PCL. Of these 40, 23 dyads (58%) met criteria of risk for chronic emotional distress by having at least one person (patient or caregiver) that endorsed clinically significant symptoms of either depression, anxiety, or PTS. Of these 23 dyads, three (13%) declined to consent after screening. Twenty dyads completed the informed consent process. Three of the 20 consented dyads (15%) declined to enroll after the informed consent process. The remaining 17 dyads were randomized seven to intervention and ten in control. One dyad in the control condition dropped out of the study after enrollment and randomization procedures, but prior to the completion of baseline measures, citing concerns about finishing study procedures prior to discharge (see Fig. 1). Acceptability of randomization The CONSORT diagram (Fig. 1) shows the flow of participants in the study. Acceptability of randomization was excellent, and no RT dyads refused to participate in the study after randomization to condition. Acceptability of study procedures Among RT dyads, acceptability of study procedures was high. All dyads provided post-test data (n = 7; 100%), and all but one dyad (n = 6; 85%) provided 3-month follow-up. All dyads who completed baseline measures in the MEUC condition provided post-test data (n = 9; 100%), and all but one dyad (n = 8; 88.9%) provided 3month follow-up. Treatment adherence was good, with four of the seven dyads in RT attending 6/6 sessions, two dyads attending 4/6 sessions, and one dyad failing to attend any sessions because the caregiver lived in a different state, worked full time, and could not travel to the Neuro-ICU during regular hours and study staff was unable to install the video software prior to discharge. Feasibility of quantitative measures Feasibility of quantitative measures was high. All participants in both treatment conditions completed baseline measures and there was minimal missing Bannon et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies (2020) 6:75 Page 8 of 16 data. One caregiver in the RT condition and one dyad (patient and caregiver) in the MEUC condition failed to complete post-test measures. Completion of the 3-month measures was also high, and 14 of the 17 dyads completed all quantitative measures (six RT, eight MEUC). Of the participants that completed questionnaires, no measure/inventory was missing in full. For caregivers, internal consistency of measures was high for all measures. For patients, internal reliability was acceptable to excellent in most measures except the IBM, and the HADS-D and CAMS-R, which both improved after baseline and had similar baseline coefficients to those reported in previous studies . Treatment credibility and expectancy Average credibility and expectancy ratings were high for both RT and MEUC patients and caregivers (Table 3). Satisfaction with program Neither patients nor therapists reported substantial challenges with the video platform and were satisfied with the live, remote delivery using their computers, tablets, or phones. Many patients and caregivers expressed enthusiasm and gratitude for the video platform, which did not require travel to the hospital in-person. Treatment satisfaction (CSQ-3) was rated at post-test and was high for both conditions, though higher for dyads in the RT condition (Table 3). Means, standard deviations, and ranges Means, standard deviations, and ranges for all study outcomes at each time point are depicted for patients and their informal caregivers, separately for RT or MEUC in Table 3.

Within group changes in outcomes Participation in RT was associated with baseline to posttest decrease in symptoms of depression, anxiety, and PTS (medium to large effect sizes) in patients (d = −.41, −1.25, and −.83, respectively) and caregivers (d = −.63, −.81, and −.98). Except for patient depression symptoms, changes were all above established MICDs for dyads in RT. Receipt of MEUC was associated with clinically significant increases in symptoms of depression, anxiety, and PTS (medium to large effect sizes) for patients (d = .98, .44, and .68) from baseline to post-test. For caregivers receiving MEUC, baseline to post-test increases in symptoms of depression, anxiety, and PTS were also observed (d = .71, .48, and .46), and increases in depression symptoms exceeded MCID values. Gains in resiliency variables, such as self-efficacy, mindfulness, and perceived coping, demonstrated small to large effect sizes (d = .07–.85) in RT but not MEUC dyads from baseline to post-test (see Table 3). Within-subject effect sizes for RT between post-test and 3 months showed a slight increase in symptoms (small to medium effect sizes) of depression, anxiety, and PTS for patients (d = .08, .06, and .36, respectively). These increases, however, were not clinically significant per MCID; 3 months mean scores of emotional distress remained lower than at baseline.

Within subject effect sizes for MEUC from post-test to 3 months indicated decreases in symptoms (medium effect sizes) for depression, anxiety, and PTS, for patients (d = .46, .45, and .43), though there were not clinically significant and mean scores at the 3-month follow-up remained higher than baseline. Caregivers in MEUC demonstrated slight decreases in depression and anxiety symptoms from post-test to 3 months (small to medium effect sizes; d = .02, .32) and slight increases in PTS symptoms (d = .22) but all were not clinically meaningful. All scores at the 3-month follow-up remained higher than baseline. Overall, we observed a general trend for decrease in emotional distress from baseline through 3 months for RT dyads, and an increase in emotional distress for MEUC dyads in the same time frame. Clinically significant symptoms At baseline, a majority of patients and caregivers screened positive for anxiety and PTS, with fewer screening for depression (Table 4). At post-intervention assessment, the rates of clinically significant anxiety and PTS for patients and caregivers in RT were substantially lower. Improvements in depression symptoms were seen in RT caregivers at post-intervention that persisted through the 3-month follow up, though RT patients' rates remained stable (14.3%) throughout the study assessment period. In MEUC dyads, we observed increases in rates of clinically significant symptoms of depression, anxiety, and PTS at post-intervention and 3 months. Discussion We conducted a randomized controlled feasibility trial of a dyadic resiliency intervention (Recovering Together; RT) versus a minimally enhanced usual care (MEUC) comparison, with the goal of informing the design and conduct of a future hybrid efficacy-effectiveness study aimed at preventing chronic emotional distress in stroke patients and their informal caregivers. Recruitment was challenging and many dyads were missed before study staff was able to approach. However, once recruited and randomized, dyads in the RT condition attended most study sessions and nearly all dyads in both conditions completed post-test and follow-up questionnaires. Attrition was better than in other clinical protocols of stroke patients and their informal caregivers . There were no technical issues associated with the delivery of RT via secure live video. The feasibility and acceptability of study procedures was also high, though some questionnaires demonstrated low internal reliability for patients at baseline. Additional measures of study feasibility such as credibility, expectancy, and satisfaction were also high. These results are encouraging and show that patients Table 4 Percentage of participants meeting criteria for emotional disorders Bannon et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies (2020) 6:75 Page 12 of 16 with stroke and their caregivers are generally receptive to psychosocial interventions targeting prevention of chronic emotional distress. Exploration of within-group effect sizes demonstrated improvement (decreased symptoms) in all emotional distress outcomes between baseline and post-test (moderate to large effect sizes) in RT, with improvements over MCIDs for anxiety and PTS in patients and for depression, anxiety, and PTS in caregivers. Symptoms increased slightly from post-test to 3 months for RT dyads, though none of the changes were clinically significant. In contrast, patients in the MEUC condition demonstrated clinically significant increases in symptoms in all emotional distress outcomes between baseline and post-test (medium to large effect sizes) and caregivers (above MCID for depression symptoms). Symptoms slightly decreased from post-test to 3 months for MEUC dyads, though all decreases were below MCID values. Over the course of 3 months (baseline to 3 months), we observed a general improvement in emotional distress for dyads randomized to RT and a general deterioration in symptoms for those in MEUC. Across all dyads, clinically significant symptoms of anxiety and PTS symptoms were more common than symptoms of depression. We observed a substantial decrease in frequency of both patients and caregivers with clinically significant emotional distress from baseline to both post-intervention and 3 months for those randomized to RT. Of note, in the RT condition, the percentage of patients exhibiting clinically significant depression symptoms at baseline was low (14.3; one patient) and remained stable; rates of clinically significant depression symptoms were higher in RT caregivers (28.6%; two caregivers) and improved to 0% at post-test and 3 months. In MEUC, rates of clinically significant depression, anxiety, and PTS remained stable or increased. Taken together, these findings show evidence of potential benefit from RT in reducing risk for chronic anxiety and PTS in both stroke patients and caregivers, but no evidence for improvement in depression. This may be a function of the small sample size with only seven cases of depression, as well as stroke-related biochemical changes in depression, lack of skills in RT to properly target depressive symptoms, or a combination of these factors. The substantial deterioration in symptoms observed in MEUC is consistent with prior studies which show that emotional distress at hospitalization predicts future emotional distress in both patients and caregivers . These findings underscore the need for proactive intervention for prevention of emotional sequelae that occur in the wake of stroke for dyads . This feasibility trial allowed us to study and understand challenges of conducting research in a high stress and busy Neuro-ICU setting. There were many lessons learned (Table 5) which will be implemented in the future trial in order to streamline recruitment. One of the most challenging aspects of the study was reaching the substantial volume of patients with stroke to evaluate eligibility. The Neuro-ICU admission rate is high, and many patients are hospitalized for only a few days, during which their exhaustion and medical acuity is high. It was difficult for study staff to determine, based on the medical record alone, which dyads would be likely to meet study criteria including medical clearance to participate. Although we screened as many dyads as possible, we likely missed many potentially eligible dyads while screening many who ended up unable to participate due to impaired medical or cognitive presentation. Taken together, these findings highlight the need to work closely with the Neuro-ICU medical and nursing team to streamline recruitment so that we can approached only those dyads who are medically and cognitively cleared for participation by the medical team. With funding from the National Institute of Nursing Research, we are now conducting a proof of concept RCT that enrolls at risk dyads with any acute brain injury, as our prior studies did not find any differences in emotional distress by type of diagnoses [7–10, 15]. This RCT also employs an attention placebo control matched in time and dose with RT, in order to strengthen the internal validity of findings. That is directly informed by lessons learned from the current study (Table 5). This RCT is directly informed by lessons learned from the current trial. Specifically, we have strengthened our collaboration with the nursing team in the Neuro-ICU, so that nurses now see the value of our work and are invested in helping with the study. We engaged nurses in the development and refinement of study procedures including methodology for recruitment and retention, have identified a nurse champion who is the point of contact on all cases, and keep nurses actively involved through monthly presentations and anonymous surveys of engagement and satisfaction. Our current recruitment strategies are more effective and efficient. Each morning, study staff meets with the nurse champion who identifies all potential participants who are medically and cognitively able to enroll. The nurse champion or bedside nurse introduce the study team to the patient through a “warm hand-off” to increase buy in, coordinate screening of informal caregivers, as well as other services on the floor to ensure uninterrupted time for consent, questionnaire administration, and in-hospital sessions. We are now generally completing enrollment and the first dyadic session in 1 day to minimize drop-off after screening or after consent and before first sessions. We now adopt a more flexible approach to screening patients for emotional distress. While we approach participants as soon as possible after Bannon et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies (2020) 6:75 Page 13 of 16 diagnoses, in situations where mental status is low or the medical team does not think the patient is able to consent and meaningfully participate, our team will approach patients at later timepoints prior to discharge. We are also flexible in conducting the in-hospital visits and allow caregivers to participate virtually in cases where the caregiver lives out of state and is unable to come to the clinic during hospital hours, and conduct visits early morning and evenings when needed. We also considered revisions to study measures in the current proof of concept RCT. Though we observed an unusual pattern of uniform responding (SD = 0) among RT caregivers, our measure of program acceptability has demonstrated utility in treatment studies for a number of chronic medical conditions , and was likely due to our small sample size (n = 6 caregivers). Further, we observed low internal reliability in some of our baseline questionnaires administered to patients, though most were within or near the ranges of coefficients reported in published studies. Specifically, patients exhibited inconsistent response patterns to the IBM, a measure of the patient-caregiver relationship that assesses dyadic care and dyadic control. While outside of the scope of the present study, it is possible that the circumstances surrounding the hospitalization impacted patient consistency in responding to the questionnaire items. For example, participants may have responded to the prompt that their partner, “Tends to control everything I do,” considering orders from their medical team to promote recovery. Recognizing that the IBM may have conflated expressions of care and concern, we instead included the Dyadic Relationship Scale  as a measure of positive dyadic interactions in our current proof of concept RCT. Reliability for the DRS has also been established in cognitively impaired patient populations . Following ours and others observations that some patients’ responses may be impacted by cognitive functioning , we are now ensuring the validity of patient measures in the hospital by checking patient’s mental status before administration and by checking answers to the reversed scored items immediately after questionnaire completion. Using these strategies, our ability to recruit participants has dramatically increased, and we have enrolled 52 participants over the course of 8 months. In sum, the present feasibility randomized control trial provided valuable information for the design of future studies and further development of RT. Using lessons learned from this feasibility trial, we substantially improved methodology and recruitment and are now conducting a proof of concept RCT where we explore treatment effects with a larger sample and pay particular attention to addressing depressive symptoms where these are present. Investment in this proof of concept trial rather than directly conducting a fully powered RCT is allowing us to test proposed methodologies and lessons learned from this trial without the risk wasting time and resources. This is particularly important as prior critical care trials aimed at preventing chronic emotional distress after critical care admission have failed to show efficacy . Conclusions We conducted a feasibility trial of Recovering Together, the first dyadic intervention aimed at preventing chronic emotional distress in at-risk stroke patients and their informal caregivers, relative to minimally enhanced usual care (MEUC). We found promising evidence for the feasibility and acceptability of recruitment and study procedures that directly informed a proof of concept feasibility RCT and a future hybrid efficacy-effectiveness trial. We provide information on valuable lessons learned that can inform critical care research for medical patients.

       " 'Introduction Ten million cases of traumatic brain injury (TBI) are reported worldwide each year (Barman et al., 2011). TBI is one of the leading causes of mortality and disability and has become a worldwide public health issue (Stålnacke et al., 2019). According to an epidemiological survey (Huo et al., 2015), the incidence of TBI in China is about 240 cases for every 10 million people. However, because of the advances in critical medical technology, more patients with severe brain injury survive, leading to a growing number of patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC) in China (Xia et al., 2018). DOC are a collection of transitory syndromes, encompassing coma, unresponsive wakefulness syndrome, and the minimally conscious state (Graham, 2020). Patients with DOC, caused by severe brain injury, pose a great ﬁnancial strain on their families, increase burnout rates in nursing, and give rise to ethical discussions (Schnakers & Monti, 2017). Normally, healthcare professionals often inform patients of their condition and treatment plan through informed consent, and the patients decide whether to continue treatment. However, DOC patients remain in a life-threatening state with an uncertain prognosis for a long time, which can render them incapable to provide informed consent or refuse medical treatment (Long et al., 2011). Moreover, cognitive impairments prevent DOC patients from communicating eﬀectively (Landsness et al., 2011). Research indicates that 95% of them lack the ability to make decisions and express preferences (Cai et al., 2015). For these reasons, their family members are regarded as their surrogates and assist with medical decision-making (Sequeira & Lewis, 2017). Surrogate decision-makers may make clinical decisions about diagnostic and surgical procedures, including life-sustaining interventions and end-of-life care. In addition, healthcare professionals will solicit them for guidance on the patient’s treatment preferences (Hickman & Pinto, 2014). However, it is the ﬁrst time for most surrogates to encounter such an accident, and they are unsure of the desired health outcome their loved ones will consider acceptable (Turnbull et al., 2016). Decisional dilemmas and conﬂicts are inherent in the decision-making process and present tremendous challenges to the family surrogate decision-makers. Since many surrogates are unprepared to serve in this role, they are at risk for long-term adverse psychological outcomes such as decision regret, decision fatigue, and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (Zahuranec et al., 2018). It is reported NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL REHABILITATION 1583 that 14%∼81% of the family members have symptoms of PTSD after participating in the decision-making process (Petrinec & Daly, 2016). The prevalence of PTSD exceeded 80% when the decision involved end-of-life decisions (Azoulay et al., 2005). Further, the decision-making process may diﬀer by culture which directly aﬀects individual behaviours (Sun et al., 2020). Traditional Chinese culture is deeply rooted in the ancient philosophies of Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism. As a result, its cultural landscape is diverse rather than a monolithic entity, which makes the surrogate decision-making process embody cultural characteristics. For example, ﬁlial piety has been the essence of Chinese feudal ethics since ancient times. Besides, discussing the issue of life and death of seriously ill or dying patients is still a taboo subject in the Chinese context, which poses great challenges for eﬀective communication between healthcare professionals and family members. In addition, Chinese family culture is family-oriented, which means the family is a community of life (Wei et al., 2019). The individual’s disease and survival rights are shared by the family, which plays a decisive role in making health decisions (Li & Zuo, 2016). Therefore, the cultural beliefs of family members may provide family surrogate decision-makers with more challenges and complex decisions. Many documented studies are mainly about the accuracy of surrogate decisions (Frey et al., 2014; Shalowitz et al., 2006), the underlying factors and the relations between outcomes of surrogate decision-making (Hammami et al., 2020; Spalding & Edelstein, 2022), and the extent of preference overlap between surrogate decision-makers and patients (Frey et al., 2018). Nonetheless, little is known about the family surrogate decision-makers’ experience during the decision-making process. In addition, globalization trends promote an increase in immigration and enables the spread of Chinese culture. As reported (Guo et al., 2021; Stevenson et al., 2018), Chinese individuals are the largest Asian American group in the USA and is one of the largest visible minority groups in Canada, comprising 21% of Canada’s visible minority population. Thus, the purpose of this study is to explore Chinese family surrogate decisionmakers’ perspectives of decision-making, amidst the diversity and uniqueness of Chinese culture. We hope the ﬁndings can provide healthcare professionals with guidance regarding optimal decision-making for DOC patients with similar cultural backgrounds from diﬀerent countries. Methods Aim This study aimed to explore and describe the family surrogate decision-makers’ views on the decision-making of patients with DOC. 1584 J. CHEN ET AL. Design The qualitative thematic analysis approach (Vaismoradi et al., 2013) was employed to identify, analyse, and report themes within the concepts that reﬂected family surrogate decision-makers’ perceptions of decision-making of patients with DOC. Semi-structured face-to-face interviews that could allow participants to freely describe their experiences and emotions ﬂexibly were adopted (Denzin, 2007). Participants Participants were purposively recruited from the neurological ICU of a tertiary hospital in Shanghai, China. The researchers only contacted participants who matched the criteria to ensure voluntary participation. The inclusion criteria as follows: family members should be 18 years old or older, be represented as a surrogate decision-maker of a patient who is diagnosed with DOC for the ﬁrst time and lacks decision-making capacity, and can speak and understand Mandarin. Overall, 21 of 30 eligible family surrogate decision-makers were enrolled in the study. Eight family surrogate decision-makers declined to Table 1.

The demographic characteristics of the participants are shown in Table 1. The demographic characteristics of the patients are shown in Table 2. Data collection All the interviews were conducted with family surrogate decision-makers between January 2021 to February 2021. The researchers introduced the purpose of the study, conﬁrmed each participants’ voluntary participation, and established a relationship prior to study commencement. Before beginning the interviews, all participants ﬁnished a questionnaire of demographic characteristics. The semi-structured interview guide (Table 3) was developed based on the purpose of the study and modiﬁed based on one prior interview conducted. All interviews were audio-recorded with the permission of the participants. Each participant was asked several open-ended questions, according to the interview guide, by the ﬁrst author and co-ﬁrst author who had previously received training in qualitative research. All interviews were conducted in Mandarin. The average duration of the interviews was 38 min (range 29–59 min). Data collection continued until no new themes were identiﬁed (Bryon et al., 2010). Upon reaching the 19th interview, no new themes were identiﬁed. Two other Table 2. Demographic characteristics of the patients (N = 21).

CHEN ET AL. interviews were conducted to conﬁrm the theoretical saturation. Still, no new themes were identiﬁed. Ethical considerations Ethical approval was obtained from the Ethics Committee of Shanghai Tenth People’s Hospital (SHSY-IEC-4.1/19-163/01). All individuals voluntarily participated, and received verbal and written informed consent about the study before the interviews were carried out. The participants were informed of their right to withdraw from the interviews at any time. The audio recordings and transcripts were available for this study only, and will be destroyed once the study is ﬁnished. Data analysis Twenty-one interviews were conducted. All audio recordings of the interviews were transcribed verbatim by the ﬁrst author. The authors then doublechecked the transcripts for accuracy and returned them to the participants for veriﬁcation. After conﬁrming the accuracy of the transcripts, the ﬁrst author translated them to English. Thereafter, the co-ﬁrst author and second author checked the accuracy of the translation using a back-translation method – wherein the English was translated back into Mandarin. Finally, the co-corresponding author, who has a certiﬁcate of interpretation accreditation test and used to be a visiting scholar in the US, double-checked the translation. The English transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2006) by (1) reading the transcripts in detail several times, in order to ensure familiarity with the depth and breadth of their content; (2) formulating the meaningful statements relevant to the purpose of the study and encoding as many initial codes as possible; (3) sorting the diﬀerent codes into potential themes and building a collection of themes and sub-themes; (4) reviewing the themes, collapsing some themes into others, and breaking down some themes into smaller components; and (5) deﬁning and naming themes. In this study, two researchers carried out the coding process of transcripts independently. Thereafter, they compared and veriﬁed the themes until a consensus was reached. Table 3. Interview guide.

NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL REHABILITATION 1587 Trustworthiness To ensure the trustworthiness of the study, Lincoln and Guba’s (1985) study’s evaluative criteria using analytical triangulation (Patton, 2015) was used. Before the data analysis, the ﬁrst author translated all transcripts into English, then the second author back translated them, and the third author doublechecked them to verify the accuracy of the interviews and enhance the credibility. The transcripts were repeatedly and independently analysed, compared, and veriﬁed in multiple directions by three authors. The authors then discussed and compared themes to ensure the credibility of the ﬁnal themes. Findings A tough choice between life and dignity Sub-theme: Sustaining life due to its sacredness (Table 4) Diﬀerent belief systems have an impact on the choice of therapeutic regimes. Some participants (n = 5) indicated that some family surrogate decision-makers believe that life is sacred and precious, so they should provide active treatment instead of abandoning it. Although it’s very painful for comatose patients, in my opinion, life is so precious that we can’t abandon it. (N18) Participants (n = 7) highlighted that the family members’ belief that nothing is more important than human life would inﬂuence the decision-making process as well. Participants also mentioned (n = 3) that most family members were eager for the extension of their relative’s life. I strongly want to keep the patient and prolong his life, even if he only has breathing. (N6) Sub-theme: Foregoing treatment to save the patient’s dignity Some family surrogate decision-makers give priority to quality of life. When DOC patients have a low quality of life, the family members will reject painful invasive manipulations and choose to let the patients die with great dignity. Table 4. Themes and sub-themes. Themes Sub-themes A tough choice between life and dignity Sustaining life due to its sacredness Foregoing treatment to save the patient’s dignity A major responsibility for patient’s voice Complex considerations between ethics and morals The impact of kinship and ﬁlial piety on clinical decisionmaking Diﬀerent understanding of illness experience The importance of realistic basis Medical technology Prognosis 1588 J. CHEN ET AL. Our family said that they didn’t want their family to suﬀer a lot and live without quality at the terminal stage. So, we decided to give up. (N8) Moreover, participants (n = 10) indicated that when faced with patients in critical condition, they prioritised quality of life, as they believed that instead of allowing patients to continue accepting advanced life support and maintain life without quality, it was better to let them pass away peacefully. The quality of life is poor. DOC patients have no quality of life and are, from my side, unconscious and helpless. (N10) However, some participants (n = 3) indicated that selecting the communication style to have other immediate family members make a rational judgment about giving life without quality up, has become an issue currently considered in family meetings. My mother has neither dignity nor quality of life. I have told my father and sibling that if she can’t bear it, then give up, but I don’t know how to talk to them. (N4) A major responsibility for patient’s voice Since DOC patients lack decision-making capacity and cannot choose clinical treatment autonomously, family surrogate decision-makers should make decisions on behalf of them, which makes the family surrogate decisionmakers shoulder the heavy responsibility of speaking out for the patients. If you don’t decide, who will make the decision? Only you can make the decision, you have to bear it. (N14) This heavy responsibility is also reﬂected when family surrogate decisionmakers need to conceal the patient’s condition to certain members, such as family members who have poor resilience, because they fear that the patient’s condition will deal a heavy blow to these family members. Family surrogate decision-makers often make decisions alone under these circumstances, and they will be under more pressure and assume more responsibilities. I didn’t tell my sister [mother’s condition] because she was going to take the entrance examination for high school, and I made the decision by myself. (N3) The surrogate’s decision is usually related to the patient’s subsequent recovery, even their lives. Therefore, this is also a huge challenge for the family surrogate decision-makers. This is my mother’s second chance to live. This decision is of great help to her later treatment. (N6) Complex considerations between ethics and morals Sub-theme: The impact of kinship and ﬁlial piety on clinical decision-making NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL REHABILITATION 1589 Family bond was one of the factors that inﬂuenced surrogate decisionmaking. This emotional belief has not only become the main motivation for family members not to give up, but has also become an indispensable part of their lives. To this end, several family surrogate decision-makers show a reluctance to let the patient go. Aﬀection was the greatest strength that supports our family members. My wife is 70year-old woman who was out of hope [for] a cure, I have let go of [my] feelings and sold our house for her treatment. (N21) Furthermore, to guard against a perception from others that they are not showing appropriate ﬁlial piety and to gain social acceptability, family members will do anything they can to rescue their family member. Traditional Chinese thinking focuses on ﬁlial piety. I want to give up (stop treatment) but I am afraid of being blamed [for] an ungrateful attitude. Finally, I chose to adhere to the treatment. (N15) It is when your family suddenly becomes ill that you realize you don’t do your ﬁlial piety. Then you want to do something for your family. (N17) Sub-theme: Diﬀerent understanding of illness experience Family members have diﬀerent perceptions of illness experience, especially of the decisions regarding invasive procedures. Some family members who disapprove of such procedures think that the pain caused by invasive procedures outweighs the suﬀering caused by the disease, while other family members believe that carrying out invasive procedures could prevent and relieve the secondary pain caused by the disease. I cannot accept the tracheotomy, thinking the prognosis will be bad. (N12) The tracheotomy doesn’t matter compared with her current condition. Provided there is a gleam of hope for her recovery, I will do it. (N8) Yet another perception is reﬂected when comatose patients are bound by physical restraints, which is used commonly in the ICU. Since healthcare professionals pay attention to the psychological pain suﬀered by conscious patients, they can understand their stigma. For patients in a comatose state, however, family members are often more focused on humanistic care. Another point is the use of restraint bands. I think it’s contrary to humanity. If he is awake, he must feel that he has no dignity. (N19) The importance of realistic basis Sub-theme: Medical technology Some participants (n = 3) believe that although there are many new treatments and theories emerging, there are still many areas that have not been 1590 J. CHEN ET AL. addressed regarding the treatment of DOC patients. When faced with cases that could not be solved by current medical practices, family members found themselves willing – but unable – to avail proper treatment for their family. I feel that current medical technology can’t cure him. His condition is worse oﬀ, and the current technology can only be like this. (N6) More than half of the DOC patients in this study are from small rural towns, where the medical standards and disproportionate medical conditions are not conducive to further treatment of patients. Therefore, the family surrogate decision-makers will elect to transfer a patient to a developed area with leading advanced medical standards at any cost. The doctor (of county town) advised us not to transfer. I said no. We said we must transfer because the medical conditions in our county town are not good. (N7) Although participants (n = 5) have encountered the limitations of the development of modern medicine during the treatment process, they were not discouraged from rescuing patients. On the contrary, they were motivated and believe that healthcare professionals would seek the necessary research data to further explore treatment methods. Despite [having] tried our best, we can only go this far. I think the development of medicine still requires persistent people to overcome the problems. If we don’t persist, we may stand helpless when we encounter a similar [problem] next time. (N20) Sub-theme: Prognosis Some participants described that in the decision-making process, the prognosis of DOC patients should be addressed as a priority, and subsequent decisions will be based on their recovery. In the acute phase of the disease, family surrogate decision-makers are mainly trying their best to save patients’ lives. Now we mainly focus in saving her life. The follow-up issues we will discuss later on. (N9) In the stable period of the disease, the family surrogate decision-makers are concerned about the follow-up rehabilitation issues, so as to determine the setting of rehabilitation, personnel arrangements, and other issues. If she can recover normally, going to the rehabilitation centre will be of great help to her later treatments. Later, I will arrange division of care after she gets home. (N7) Discussion Traditional Chinese culture emphasizes that the meaning of life lies in the present world (Hao, 2010). Therefore, many family members advocate for the theory of the sanctity of life. This conception also explained why family NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL REHABILITATION 1591 members were eager to prolong DOC patients’ lives. However, this did not increase the chances of survival, and could cause harm and result in the overtreatment of incurable patients (Dzeng & Curtis, 2018). Moreover, the patients’ family members would experience a higher symptom burden. McAdam et al. (2010) indicated that 57% of family members had moderate to severe levels of traumatic stress, and 70%∼80% of them had borderline symptoms of depression. In order to address the popular perception of life support treatment and promote that of palliative care (Peden-McAlpine et al., 2015), as well as improve the quality of death of critically ill patients, healthcare professionals could provide an inpatient palliative care program. Enguidanos et al. (2014) found that communication and information received contributed to the family members’ ability to make decisions. Furthermore this can make a distinct change in clinical direction, from a traditional disease-centred approach to a holistic approach focusing on quality of life and comfort. The challenges of discussing prognosis of DOC patients among families revealed that the taboo of talking about death and dying had permeated Chinese culture. In this study, the participants realised their total responsibility to serve in the role of a surrogate decision-maker; meanwhile, they were ﬁlled with moral unease when communicating with other family members of dying patients, as they were worried that the end-of-life decision could crush other family members’ spirits. A cohort study found that surrogate decision-makers’ beliefs during a discussion on death could be emotionally damaging to their family members (Apatira et al., 2008). In Chinese society, people make use of implicit communication. They do not spell everything out, but leave the “unspoken” meaning to the listeners (Liu et al., 2005). In addition, some family surrogate decision-makers will think twice before talking to their relatives. Thus, it is essential for healthcare professionals to understand the cultural sensitivity in such a context, as this could strengthen supportive communication and show greater consideration for families’ feelings (Tao et al., 2016). Our ﬁndings highlighted that 52% of family surrogate decision-makers are patients’ children. The ﬁlial piety is a major emotional factor and impetus for them to make surrogate decisions. Family ethics is vital to maintaining a family bond and is a common emotional behaviour criterion (Qiu et al., 2018) that regulates the relationship between children and their parents (Ruan & Zhou, 2019). Whether children engage in the active treatment of their parents has become a standard for moral judgment. Thus, healthcare professionals may face more challenges when telling families that withdrawing life-sustaining treatment is another way to practice ﬁlial piety. Therefore, healthcare professionals should take actions to popularise bereavement support, set grieving families free from public pressure, and promote the understanding that it is human beings’ great love that turns kinship into a spirituality concern (Zhang et al., 2019). 1592 J. CHEN ET AL. It was revealed that family surrogate decision-makers had diﬀerent understandings of illness experience. According to Confucian familyism, the holistic wisdom of the family is greater than that of the individual, since families believe that they can make the optimal decision for the patient (Sun, 2017). Rolland et al. (2017) posed that if family systems were included in medical decision-making, medical decisions could be less conﬂicted and less emotional suﬀering would be felt by both clinicians and families. However, our ﬁndings provided insight that some medical decisions would contradict the actual condition of the patient and hamper clinical operation implementation. This indicates that the perception of illness experience of family members was diﬀerent, and to some extent, not sympathetic. Thus, healthcare professionals should respect the decisions of families and combine their illness experience with ethical principles and medical interests. Besides, Wong et al. (2020) found when healthcare professionals communicated with family members clearer, were more transparent and interacted with patience and empathy, and were responsive to their concerns, family members were less stressed and respected. In this study, when patients’ vital signs decreased, family members could do nothing but feel sympathy, due to the limitations of critical care technology and the uncertain prognosis. This emotional exhaustion aﬀects surrogate decisionmakers’ physical and mental health. The persistent state of heightened emotional distress can destroy surrogate decision makers’ internal and external ﬂexible resource, resulting in a state of ego depletion (Hickman et al., 2018). Moreover, the psychological distress of critical illness and state of high negative emotions can inﬂuence decision-makers’ ability to formulate optional decisions (Hickman & Douglas, 2010). Consequently, in order to improve the psychological resilience of family surrogate decision-makers, healthcare professionals should actively address existing psychological problems and enhance family surrogate decision-makers’ abilities to react positively despite the diﬃculties encountered – turning these situations into opportunities for growth (Sisto et al., 2019). Limitations The study had some limitations. Firstly, the researchers’ native language is Mandarin. This may have resulted in misinterpretations during the translation stage. Nevertheless, the researchers veriﬁed the accuracy of the translations during each step to ensure their trustworthiness. Secondly, all 21 participants were married, which could contribute to bias. The participants’ perspectives on the same issue could diﬀer due to the responsibility of family. Therefore, more diverse target groups should be enrolled in future studies. Thirdly, the hospital where the participants were selected is situated in a developed coastal city of China. Since the development of medical technology and level of consumption NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL REHABILITATION 1593 may diﬀer cross regions, further research on the medical settings of developing regions is needed. Fourthly, the participants were selected according to the state of consciousness of the patients instead of the process of the disease. Therefore, we were unable to identify participants’ perspectives of decisionmaking about diﬀerent stage of the disease, like the acute versus stable stage. Conclusions In the neurological ICU, decision-making for DOC patients is signiﬁcantly more diﬃcult than for conscious patients. These ﬁndings hinted at the family surrogate decision-makers’ experiences and decisional dilemmas in decisionmaking for DOC patients under the Chinese culture framework. The results emphasize the need for healthcare professionals to oﬀer decision-making assistance to family surrogate decision-makers and pay attention to their psychological needs so that informed decisions could be formulated. To best protect the rights and make the surrogate decisions in the best interest of DOC patients, further research on improving the collaboration between healthcare professionals and family surrogate decision-makers in the diversity of care of DOC patients, such as the role of shared decision-making, should be conducted.',\n",

Several clinical studies have shown the contribution of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) feeding after stroke in terms of improving nutritional status and reducing mortality. The aim of this study is to compare the burden and depression among caregivers of ischemic stroke patients fed with PEG and orally. Methods: A total of 63 caregivers of patients with acute ischemic stroke who were followed up in the neurointensive care unit with modiﬁed Rankin Scale 4 or 5 were recruited in this cross-sectional survey. Clinical data of patients and demographical proﬁle as age, gender, kinship to patient, income, and level of education of caregivers were recorded. On their 3rd-month follow-up visit, Beck Depression Inventory and The Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) were administered to caregivers to evaluate depressive symptoms and caregiver burden. A semi-structured questionnairre was developed and conducted by the researchers with the caregivers to assess their thoughts of nutrition. Results: Thirty-two caregivers of stroke patients on PEG and 31 caregivers of stroke patients who were fed orally were evaluated. The groups did not differ statistically in terms of demographic variables and depression scores (p > 0.05). However, the mean score of ZBI was signiﬁcantly higher in the group of caregivers of stroke patients who were fed orally (p ¼ 0.00). Caregivers of stroke patients on PEG had higher scores of caregivers’ thoughts of nutrition support therapy questionnairre (p ¼ 0.00). Conclusions: Our ﬁndings demonstrate that caregivers of stroke patients report lower burden and higher level of positive thinking with PEG feeding than oral feeding. This suggests that nutritional care could include convenient and practicable methods for caregivers of patients with stroke in order to meet patients’ nutritional requirements. © 2019 European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

Introduction People with stroke may suffer from difﬁculties associated with eating and drinking due to impaired consciousness, swallowing deﬁcits, reduced mobility, and arm or facial weakness, fatigue, and visual-perceptual impairment. These patients are therefore at risk of disease-related malnutrition . Dysphagia, difﬁculty with swallowing, is common after acute stroke, occurring in 20%e65% of patients. The great variation in prevalence can depend on the heterogeneity of the patient population, timing of nutritional assessment and the diagnostic method used. Nutritional impairment can lead to serious complications outcomes (e.g., prolonged hospital stay, developing infections, decreased quality of life, higher mortality rates), in patients with both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke [2e7]. For this reason, nutrition should be considered as part of stroke treatment . Nutrition support is recommended for malnourished patients with stroke who are unable to obtain enough protein and calorie. If the patient with stroke is able to consume food or ﬂuid orally and consume sufﬁcient quantities, oral nutritional intake should be provided; however, PEG tube placement should be considered if neurological deﬁcit cause impairment in ability to obtain sufﬁcient oral intake . Although major the stroke survivors are able to continue oral feeding, some cannot be * Corresponding author. E-mail addresses: hkaozhan@gmail.com (D.H. Ertem), faikilik@hotmail.com (F. Ilik).

All rights reserved. Clinical Nutrition ESPEN 33 (2019) 154e157 fed orally due to impaired consciousness, severe neurological deficits or dysphagia. In patients with acute stroke and dysphagia, to prevent complications resulting from the energy-protein deﬁcit, enteral nutrition with a nasogastric tube or through percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) should be provided until swallowing difﬁculties improve or the patient is able to consume orally . A high number of stroke patients with PEG tend to be older and dependent. Therefore, these group of patients require a caregiver to support them. Family caregivers of stroke patients have been reported to have stress, anxiety, exhaustion, isolation, and lower quality of life because of heavy responsibility [11e13]. Due to the unpredictable nature of stroke recovery, caregiving generally leads to being burden on family members or relatives of patients with stroke. It is evident that there is a higher risk of psychiatric symptoms among the caregivers of chronic illnesses as compared to the general population . Using PEG to feed patients with stroke may be considered as a stressor factor for caregivers in their daily lives. However, no recent study has been conducted on the role of nutrition in the burden of caregivers of patients with stroke. The present study aimed to provide new data on the nutritional burden on caregivers comparing the burden and depression levels among caregivers of ischemic stroke patients fed by PEG and orally. 2. Methods 2.1. Participants The prospective and cross-sectional study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of KTO Karatay where the study was performed (approval number: 41901325e050.99) and carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants signed an informed consent form. This study was conducted in caregivers of stroke patients who had been followed in our neurology department from January 2017 to January 2018. Ischemic stroke patients were selected to obtain a homogeneous patient group. The reason for an insertion of a PEG tube in these stroke patients was a clinical manifestation of swallowing difﬁculties. The patients were stratiﬁed into 2 groups: patients who were fed by PEG and patients who were fed orally. The study inclusion criteria were: 1) Caregivers of ischemic stroke patients with Modiﬁed Rankin Score (mRS) 4 or 5; 2) patients who were fed by PEG or orally; 3) caregiving at least 3 months by the same person. Subjects were excluded if: 1) the patients had hemorrhagic stroke; 2) the patient had PEG tubes used for other conditions; 3) other neurological or psychiatric diseases were present; 4) the caregiver had been assigned by professional health care companies; 6) the caregiver was earlier diagnosed mental illness and used psychiatric medications. Patients with similar stroke severity and dependency according to mRS were enrolled. All of the patients were fed by their caregivers. The patients who were fed orally did not have a nasogastric catheter or intravenous route and patients using PEG were not fed orally. All of the caregivers of the patients using PEG had been trained regarding PEG tube use and care. One hundred thirty-seven ischemic stroke patients were evaluated during the study period. Six patients who had developed intracerebral haemorrhage, 5 patients whose caregivers had changed, 63 patients with mRS score 1 to 3 were excluded. A total of 63 patients and their caregivers were ﬁnally enrolled in the study. 2.2. Procedures 2.2.1. Sociodemographic data form The data of the caregivers on sociodemographic variables such as age, gender, income, level of education and kinship to patient were recorded. 2.2.2. Evaluation of caregivers’ thoughts of nutrition support therapy A semi-structured questionnaire consisting of 5 questions was developed by the authors relating to the aim of this study based on relevant literature and the authors' experience. The questionnaire was conducted by the researchers to evaluate caregivers’ experience of feeding. The items on the questionairre are answered in a 5point Likert format of 1e5 corresponding to strongly disagree, disagree, neither agree nor disagree, agree and strongly agree. A higher score indicates higher positive thinking. The questions are listed below: 1. Do you think that feeding your patient is easy? 2. Do you think that feeding method of your patient is safe? 3. Do you think that your patient receives adequate nutrition? 4. Does feeding method of patient inﬂuence the workload of the caregiver? 5. Does feeding method of patient reduce caregiver's social disability? 2.2.3. The Beck Depression Inventory The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) is a 21-question, multiplechoice, self-report inventory for measuring the severity of depression . Each question has 4 alternative options and the participants are asked to select the option that best describes their feelings for the last seven days among the options scored between 0 and 4. The total score ranges from 0 to 63 and higher scores indicate more severe depressive symptoms. Turkish validity and reliability of the BDI were made by Hisli et al. . 2.2.4. The Zarit Burden Interview The Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) evaluates the subjective experience of caregiver burden quantitatively . ZBI consists of 22 questions with 5 possible answers (never, rarely, sometimes, quite frequently or nearly always). These questions assess the impact of caregiving on the physical and emotional health, social activities and ﬁnancial status of the caregiver. The total score ranges between 0 and 88 points. Higher scores on the inventory indicate higher levels of burden. The application of the scale in Turkish has been tested for validity and reliability . 2.3. Statistical analysis SPSS 23.0 was used as the statistical analysis program. Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, frequency, and percentage) were used for demographic and clinical characteristics. The ManneWhitney U test is used to compare differences between two independent groups. Pearson's Chi-square test was used for the comparison of categorical variables. The Spearman rank correlation was used for correlation analyses. P < 0.05 was considered significant in all statistical analyses. 3. Results Sixty-three stroke patients and their caregivers were assessed. Thirty-two stroke patients on PEG (age 76.59 ± 7.99; range: 62e84; 12 male) and 31 stroke patients feeding orally (age 79.83 ± 7.09; range: 66e89; 14 male) did not have a statistically signiﬁcant difference on mean age, gender, and mRS scores (p > 0.05). Demographic characteristics of the caregivers of stroke patients on PEG and feeding orally are shown in Table 1. In addition, there was no signiﬁcant difference in terms of income of the relatives of the patients (p > 0.05). No statistically signiﬁcant differences were D.H. Ertem, F. Ilik / Clinical Nutrition ESPEN 33 (2019) 154e157 155 found for socio-demographic characteristics of both caregiver groups. The mean depression and burden scores of caregiver groups are presented in Table 2. No differences in depression levels were detected according to the BDI (p ¼ 0.42). The mean burden score on the ZBI for caregivers of stroke patients on PEG was 41.68 ± 5.72, representing a moderate burden and 49 ± 5.63 for caregivers of orally fed stroke patients which also indicates a moderate burden. However, the type of nutritional feeding affected the results. Thus, the mean burden score of caregivers was higher in oral feeding over PEG (p ¼ 0.00). Table 3 shows the survey results of caregiver's opinions about patient's nutritional care. Caregivers of stroke patients on PEG had a higher scores of caregivers' satisfaction of nutrition support therapy questionnaire indicating higher level of positive thinking on their patient's feeding. In the correlation analyses, there were no correlation between BDI and ZBI (p ¼ 0.722 rho ¼ \\x02,046). 4. Discussion The aim of this study is to examine the effects of type of feeding on depression and caregiver burden in the caregivers of ischemic stroke patients population. The ﬁndings of this study demonstrated that even though both caregivers of stroke patients on PEG and who were fed orally had moderate caregiver burden, caregivers with PEG feeding reported lower burden and higher satisfaction than caregivers with oral feeding. Patient's nutritional status did not affect depressive symptoms of caregivers. In addition, according to the results of questionnaire we developed, caregivers of stroke patients on PEG stated that they found feeding with PEG easy and safe and applicable to reduce their workload. It can be concluded that lower scores of ZBI in stroke patients with PEG might be considered as the patient was adequately fed and this caused a decrease in the workload and better functioning in caregiver's social life. Recent studies reported that half of the patients with severe stroke were malnourished at some point during their hospital stay if longer than three weeks and in poststroke patients and the prevalence of malnutrition was found nearly 60% . Malnutrition, dehydration, weight loss, fatigue, aspiration pneumonia and even higher mortality risk may arise in stroke over the course of the disease with the decreased ability to swallow . It is well established that PEG tubes provide an actual beneﬁt to the patient and his caregiver on long-term quality of life. Nonetheless, there is a lack of studies investigating the relationship between feeding type in patients with stroke and the caregiver burden. In the study by Caro et al., they evaluated the burden and quality of life of family caregivers of patients with stroke . They found that moderate burden was associated with an increased risk of depression and had effects on emotional health. The authors explained the reduction in burden by patients' cognitive decline, restricted physical mobility, old age, demand for intimate care, and carer being married. Our work differs from this study in terms of some features. First, in their study, they did not explore the effects of the type of feeding on caregiver's burden. Secondly, their sample Table 1 Demographic characteristics of caregivers.

Ertem, F. Ilik / Clinical Nutrition ESPEN 33 (2019) 154e157 156 of participants were predominantly caregivers of male stroke patients without associated comorbidities. In our two caregiver samples, the distribution of gender was very similar. The authors did not ﬁnd a correlation between the level of burden and the psychological health and suggested that coping strategies and controlling emotions might be responsible for this. PEG is a minimally invasive and convenient procedure with low complication rates . PEG may provide reducing malnutrition and sequelae and improving survival for patients with impaired oral intake. However, feeding via PEG takes time and impacts daily routine of caregivers. The study by Jukic et al. is unique for assessing the difﬁculties and satisfactions of caregivers assisting older patients with home enteral nutrition therapy . The authors examined the experiences of caregivers who were not healthcare professionals, who assisted old patients treated with enteral nutrition, and identiﬁed caregivers' level of preparation, their concerns and needs. They reported that all participants testiﬁed the initial fear and refusal to manage the nutrition therapy and informal caregivers suffered from the limitation in their leisure time. By contrast, according to the results of research by Villar-Taibo et al., the intense burden was more frequent in oral over enteral nutrition . The researchers stated that the type of home artiﬁcial nutrition may be a reason for caregiver's burden. In our study, we observed that caregivers of stroke patients on PEG found feeding with PEG secure and easy to use. Our ﬁndings support the results of Villar-Taibo et al. In spite of the importance of the impact of nutrition type in the burden of caregivers of patients with stroke, there are currently no published studies regarding the assessment of levels of burden and the psychological distress toward caregivers of ischemic stroke patients fed by PEG and orally. The strength of our study includes that we compared our results with two caregiver samples who provide different types of feeding for their patients. Besides this, we evaluated the depressive symptoms among caregivers of stroke patients and demonstrated that the type of feeding did not have direct effects on depression. The study was conducted in caregivers' of ischemic stroke patients which led to identify characteristics of burden and depression in a homogeneous group of participants. The questionnaire we developed helped us to explore family caregivers' experiences from their own perspectives. However, the lack of validation of the questionnaire for the assessment of caregivers’ satisfaction of nutritional support therapy is one potential limitation of the current study. In conclusion, our ﬁndings support a beneﬁcial effect of feeding with PEG on caregiver's burden. To provide sufﬁcient nutritional care, PEG tube feeding offers a considerable medical beneﬁt in comparison with feeding orally. Further studies are needed to develop guidelines for a home-based long-term care plan to help caregivers of patients with stroke. Funding We don't have any ﬁnancial disclosures.

       " \"BACKGROUND Every year millions of patients who survive critical illness are faced with a new and complex set of consequences and challenges called survivorship.1 Intensive care unit (ICU) survivors have to deal with a different version of themselves after ICU discharge, characterized by all three adverse survivorship dimensions of physical function, cognitive function and mental health status.2 Received: 2 June 2023 Revised: 25 March 2024 Accepted: 27 March 2024  Nurs Crit Care. 2024;29:807–823. wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/nicc © 2024 British Association of Critical Care Nurses. 807 Many ICU survivors do not return to their initial health status.3 Indeed, as described in the literature, many risk factors are significantly associated with post-intensive care syndrome (PICS), such as older age,4 female gender,5 previous mental health problems4 and specific situations developed during the ICU stay, such as high disease severity,6 negative ICU experience,4 and delirium and its duration,7 which negatively impact quality of life (QoL).2,6 Authors observed that ICU survivors face different and wide sequelae after ICU discharge,8 which are identified as the three dimensions of the PICS. Psychological sequelae are common, such as depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).9 Cognitive impairments such as difficulty with memory, concentration and attention are observed.10 Also, physical consequences such as being exhausted, pain,8,11 muscular weakness12 and loss of appetite and weight13 are described. The three dimensions (physical, psychological and mental) characterize the core properties of PICS.14 In 2021, Yuan et al. defined the concept of PICS as ‘new or worsening co-occurrence of physical dysfunctions, psychological disorders, cognitive impairments or failed social reconstruction with these impairments persisting beyond ICU and hospital discharge’. This definition of the syndrome thus expresses the need to identify all three dimensions in order to develop a more comprehensive and holistic insight into PICS. In contrast, in 2020 Lee et al. found in their meta-analysis that only one study15 reported on all three attributes of PICS.4 The reason may be because PICS has been discussed for a relatively short time.14 In 2015, systematic reviews and meta-analyses were published about the impact of routine follow-up consultations on the anxiety, depression, PTSD and QoL of ICU survivors after discharge.16 The fifth edition of the Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM-5™) defines anxiety, depression and PTSD.17 Anxiety symptoms include conditions that share characteristics of elevated levels of fear or anxiety and related behavioural disturbances. Depressive symptoms refer to disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, while PTSD is a psychiatric disorder that develops in people who have experienced a traumatic event.17 This review considers all three PICS dimensions, but recent research by Yuan and colleagues18 reported that many authors chose and evaluated only a single domain of PICS rather than evaluating PICS comprehensively. Furthermore, the authors showed that anxiety and depression could be detected by a single tool and later described as PICS without consideration of the cognitive and physical dimensions.18 However, PICS affects not only the ICU survivors' health but also their relatives' health. Family post-intensive care syndrome (PICS-F), which encompasses the psychological and cognitive repercussions that ICU survivors' relatives suffer after the ICU stay, influences QoL.2,6 This syndrome has been defined by the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) to identify psychological distress experienced by ICU family members during the post-ICU period, including symptoms of anxiety, depression and PTSD,19–21 in view of family-centred care as an approach ‘that is respectful of and responsive to individual families' needs and values’. Furthermore, an essential aspect of caregiver research is determining the emotional burden described as reduced functional status during daily activities and depression and anxiety symptoms.22 Together with patient-centred care, it represents the crucial components of the quality of global care, as stated in 2001 by the Institute of Medicine Committee on Quality of Health Care in America.23 Indeed, family support in the ICU can improve survivors' outcomes by allowing families to be relatives for all intents and purposes.24 Renner explains the benefit of ICU diaries written by nurses or family members to record events about the period that critically ill patients usually cannot remember in a recent Guideline on multimodal rehabilitation for patients with post-intensive care syndrome.25 In follow-up programs, critical care nurses manage the post-discharge period by detecting the sequelae of PICS on ICU survivors and PICS-F on ICU relatives.16,26 Furthermore, the introduction of nurse-managed ICU diaries allows for reductions in the risks of anxiety, depressive symptoms and PTSD.25 Although several authors have focused their studies on analysing the effect of PICS on the health of ICU survivors27–29 and their relatives,5 no systematic review has been conducted to summarize the knowledge about the effect of PICS on both ICU survivors and their relatives. Indeed, to our knowledge, systematic reviews4,30 on PICS have been more focused on understanding the risk factors and less on the consequences, especially the multidimensional concept of the syndrome. Furthermore, a recent systematic review was published about this topic; however, authors were more focused to investigate the characteristics of existing instruments used to measure this syndrome.18 To our knowledge, researchers have been focused more on ICU survivors than on their relatives.4,13 This represents a gap in the literature because knowing PICS, identified as a comprehensive threedimension syndrome, and its effects on both the QoL of ICU survivors and their relatives will provide a different perspective to detect and implement tools and interventions aimed at these two populations. What is known about the topic • Post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) and post-intensive care syndrome-family (PICS-F) affect survivors and their relatives after critical illness survivorship. • PICS is common after acute care admission in three domains: physical, mental and cognitive. • PICS-F is characterized by psychological sequelae such as anxiety and depression. What this paper adds • PICS was associated with poor quality of life in ICU survivors and is explained predominantly by the mental component. • The mental components of PICS, such as anxiety, depression and PTSD, adversely impact ICU survivors after discharge. • Relatives who experience PICS-F report increased strainrelated symptoms and sleep disorders. 808 GRAVANTE ET AL. 14785153, 2024, 4, Downloaded from  by Aix-Marseille Universitaet, Wiley Online Library on [17/01/2026].

Furthermore, we investigate a relationship between PICS-F and their relatives ‘QoL, regardless of whether the patient displays PICS. We tested the following hypothesis: PICS is associated with a negative impact on QoL in ICU survivors. Furthermore, as described in the literature, PICS evaluation was mainly investigated only in term of the mental component.18 We therefore assume that the mental components of PICS, such as anxiety, depression and PTSD, negatively impact ICU survivors after discharge. PICS-F was associated with a negative impact on ICU relatives ‘QoL’ after discharge. 2 | DESIGN AND METHODS 2.1 | Design This systematic literature review was reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA)31 and registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42022382123). 2.2 | Search strategy and research questions A comprehensive bibliographic search was conducted on PubMed (via MEDLINE), CINAHL (via EBSCO), Scopus and Web of Science (via EBSCO) in March 2022. The search strategy included combinations and synonyms of free text and MESH (medical subject headings) terms. To identify additional studies, we also examined the reference lists of retrieved articles. We included the search terms such as (family* OR caregiver* OR ‘care partner’ OR carer OR survivor OR dyad OR patient OR carereceiver) AND (‘intensive care unit’ OR ‘intensive care’ OR ‘critical care’ OR ICU) AND (‘post intensive care syndrome’ OR ‘post care syndrome’) AND (‘quality of Life’ OR QoL OR HRQoL OR ‘Health Related Quality of Life’ OR anxiety OR depression OR stress OR burden OR ‘sleep disorder’ OR mutuality OR preparedness). The research question was: How does the onset of post-intensive care syndrome and family post-intensive care syndrome influence QoL in ICU survivors and their ICU relatives? 2.3 | Study selection We included original studies with the following inclusion criteria: (1) adult ICU survivors (> = 18 years old); (2) each outcome evaluation within the mental component of PICS; (3) study design: cohort, case– control studies, cross-sectional studies, randomized control trials (RCTs) and longitudinal studies. Regarding ICU relatives, we included articles according to the following criteria: (1) adult relatives or family (> = 18 years old); (4) any outcome evaluation within the dimensions of PICS-F; and (2) study design: cohort, case–control studies, cross-sectional studies, randomized control trials (RCTs) and longitudinal studies. Exclusion criteria were (1) studies that did not report the three dimensions of PICS as an outcome variable; (2) study design: reviews; (3) studies that had not been peer reviewed (e.g., abstract, report, editorial, and conference proceedings); and (4) studies not in English. Regarding relatives, we excluded articles according to the following criteria: (1) studies that did not assess PICS-F as an outcome variable; (2) study design: reviews; (3) studies that had not been peer reviewed (e.g., abstract, report, editorial, conference proceedings); and (4) studies not in English. We limited the search to human studies without temporary restrictions applied. 2.4 | Outcome The primary outcome of this review was the QoL of ICU survivors. The secondary outcomes were to evaluate a mental component of PICS, such as anxiety, depression, PTSD. Regarding relatives, the primary outcome was to evaluate a Qol. 2.5 | Data extraction The references obtained from the search string of each database were exported to Endnote v.x7, where duplicates were removed. The results were then uploaded to Rayyan, where two independent reviewers (FG and FT) conducted the initial screening of titles and abstracts. Subsequently, the remaining studies were examined in full text, and data extraction was performed. Non-conformities and disagreements regarding inclusion of the studies were resolved by consensus between the two evaluators; otherwise, the conflicts were resolved by a third reviewer (GP). Data extraction was performed in Microsoft Excel® 2016 via a tool built by the research team. The following information was extracted: authors and years, study design, time to follow-up, setting, PICS or PICS-F, sample size, outcome, main findings, age, gender, type of ICU, length of ICU stay, ICU delirium, acute respiratory failure, mechanical ventilation, number of PICS dimensions investigated, type of dimension explored and country. 2.6 | Evaluation of quality and data extraction Two independent reviewers (FG and FT) assessed the methodological quality of a review through the full text and the risk of bias through the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Checklist for Cohort Studies32 and JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist for RCTs.33 We used the JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist for analytical cross-sectional studies to evaluate the cross-sectional studies.34 Quality evaluation was expressed as a percentage frequency of items (yes rating) for each checklist.

Duplicate removal led to the exclusion of 2908 papers, and a further 2865 records were excluded by title and abstract screening. Eight full texts were not retrieved for screening. A total of 528 potentially relevant full-text articles were assessed for eligibility, leading to 19 papers in the review. Figure 1 shows the flow chart of the review selection process. More details of the review selection process are presented in the figure. 3.2 | Study characteristics We included 19 studies in this systematic review: 14 studies (73.7%) about the outcome in ICU survivors with PICS, three studies (15.8%) about the effect on relatives with PICS-F and two studies (10.5%) Records identified from: PUBMED (n=1739) CINAHL (n= 795) Scopus (n=1869) Web of Science (n=1898) Total (n=6301) Records removed before screening: Duplicate records removed (n = 2908) Records screened (n = 3393) Records excluded (n = 2865) Reports sought for retrieval (n =528) Reports not retrieved (n = 8) Reports assessed for eligibility (n =520) Reports excluded: 1.Generic Outcome after ICU discharge (n=238) 2.

The characteristics of the studies are shown in Table 1. Eleven studies35–45 reported the three dimensions of PICS, four studies46–49 reported two, while one study50 reported only one dimension. The most investigated dimension was mental (16 studies),35–48,50 while cognitive35–47 and physical35–45,48,49 were measured in 13 studies each. Study designs were as follows: six longitudinal studies,35,44,46,48,51,52 two retrospective studies,43,45 nine cohort studies,36–41,47,49,50 one RCT,53 and one cross-sectional study.42 All included studies described that the two groups were similar and drawn from the same population. Also, authors applied the same valid and reliable measures for all included studies.35–53 We included 3106 ICU survivors and 279 relatives in this systematic review. The sample was composed predominantly of male survivors (over 60%) in 11 studies,37–41,43–46,49,50 with an average age above 60 in nine studies.36,38,40,43–45,48–50 Six studies reported results on survivors hospitalized in a general ICU,46,36,47,37,41,48 four studies on a COVID ICU,41,42,44,45 and four studies on a medical/surgical ICU.39,40,43,49 One study each was conducted on trauma ICU survivors,35 cardiac surgery ICU survivors,50 and mixed ICU survivors.38 Fifteen studies reported on ICU length of stay.35–39,41–50 Six studies attested that ICU length of stay was around 20 days,35,36,42,44,45,47 while six studies showed an ICU length of stay of <10 days.38,39,43,46,48,49 Seven studies measured ICU delirium during ICU stay.35,38,40,41,45,46,48 Four studies reported an elevated prevalence of ICU delirium (up to 70%).35,40,45,46 Two studies showed that ICU survivors with acute respiratory failure were between 74% and 85.7%.35,47 An increasing number of survivors (up to 89%) were mechanically ventilated in four studies.40,44,45,48 Two COVID ICU survivor studies showed that around 30% of ICU survivors were nursed in a prone position during the ICU stay.41,45 Three studies51–53 showed that relatives were predominantly women aged 55, while two studies51,52 reported that 33% were a spouse. Five studies were conducted in the United States,36,40–42,45 three in Japan,38,43,48 two in Australia,37,47 and one each in Sweden,46 Portugal,49 Belgium,44 the Netherlands,39 and Scotland.50 3.3 | Quality of life in ICU survivors Of the 19 included studies, 10 studies reported on QoL in ICU survivors with PICS.36–39,41–44,47,50 Thirty-seven percent of ICU survivors were affected in more than one domain, and 73% had sequelae after one year, as Farley and Henderson reported.47,50 The mental component of PICS negatively affected the QoL of ICU survivors.38,39,43 A more substantial home rehabilitation setting was associated with increased QoL (p = .008).36 QoL was affected by PICS on different domains. QoL issues varied across different time points post-ICU discharge, with fluctuations in mobility – moderate impairment 8% of ICU survivors after 3 months, 18% after 12 months.37,41,44,50 Self-care issues were reported to be 6% after 3 months, and to be increased to 15% after 12 months.39 Pain and discomfort were reported as moderate impairment at 13% after 3 months and increased to 27% after 12 months.37 Anxiety and depression were reported in 18% of the ICU survivors after 12 months.36 Morelli et al. reported no statistically significant differences in the QoL of ICU survivors from COVID-19.42 Two studies attested to moderate and high levels of disability in ICU survivors with a PICS component,40,41 and one reported a high prevalence of sleep disorder (75%)44 (Table 1). 3.4 | PICS and anxiety, depression and PTSD of ICU survivors PICS is prevalent in ICU survivors at 43% to 96%.35,36,40,45,49 Five studies reported PICS prevalence in three domains.35,36,38,40,46 The most prevalent domain was physical impairment.35,36 Bottom-Tanzer et al. showed that 92.9% (n = 65) of ICU survivors had a physical impairment, while Dubin et al. attested to 80% (n = 40) of cases.35,36 Cognitive impairment was described in four studies. Dubin et al. reported that in 72% (n = 36) of ICU survivors, cognitive decline occurred after discharge, while in three other studies, cognitive decline occurred in between 34% and 41.4%.35,36,38,46 Three studies measured the prevalence of anxiety, depression and PTSD in ICU survivors (n = 14, 14.6%38; n = 16, 31%36; n = 30, 42.9%35). Sixteen studies reported results of the mental component of PICS on anxiety in ICU survivors.35–37,39–41,43–50 Six observational studies reported a moderate prevalence of anxiety (approximately 21%) in ICU survivors as the mental health component of PICS.43–45,47–49 Severe anxiety appeared in 18% of the cases in the study by Dubin et al. and 41% of the cases in the study by Henderson et al.36,50 Two longitudinal studies described increased anxiety levels three to 6 months after discharge.35,37 Cognitive impairment in PICS was related to high levels of anxiety.46 ICU survivors with a walking disability had a higher probability of developing anxiety symptoms (score, [min, max], 2 , 4 , p-value = .013)43 (Table 1). Fourteen studies assessed depressive symptoms as a component of PICS in ICU survivors.35–37,39–41,43–50 In 2019, Kerckhofs et al. showed that mental health, such as depressive symptoms, were associated with a self-reported unacceptable outcome to the question asked by the authors in the study (‘I consider my current condition an acceptable outcome of the ICU treatment.’) (OR = 2.06, 99% IC, 1.18–3.61).39 Three studies reported a high level of depression in ICU survivors with PICS at 3 and 6 months, respectively.40,41,43 Five studies reported a moderate level of depression in ICU survivors in a range of 20% to 32%,44,45,47–49 and one study showed that 22% of cases had severe symptoms of depression.36 In ICU survivors, two studies showed that depressive symptoms increased one to six months after discharge (baseline, n = 4 [8.5]; 1 month, n = 5  p-value = .074; 6 months, n = 10 [66.7]).35,37 Brück and colleagues reported a significant correlation relationship between PICS and depression at 3, 6 and 12 months (r = 0.510 at 3 months, p < .001; r = .590 at 6 months, p < .001; r = 0.372 at 12 months, p = .023)46 (Table 1). We identified nine studies concerning PTSD.35,36,39,41,44–46,48,49 PTSD prevalence was identified in six studies in 11% to 28% of ICU GRAVANTE ET AL. 811 14785153, 2024, 4, Downloaded from  by Aix-Marseille Universitaet, Wiley Online Library on [17/01/2026].

Still, there was a significant association between increased anxiety and depression among ICU survivors and a substantial increase in overburden among relatives.49–51 In a cohort study, 20% of relatives suffered of strain related to care; 48% reported anxiety symptoms, and 26% symptoms of depression; moreover, the majority of the sample (77%) expressed problems with sleep50 (Table 1).

See the Terms and Conditions ( on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License 4 | DISCUSSION This review aimed to examine the impact of PICS and PICS-F on QoL in ICU survivors and their relatives after discharge, respectively, and the reporting of anxiety, depression and PTSD in studies investigating ICU survivors with PICS. Our main findings were (1) mobility, pain, discomfort and disability as the domains of QoL most affected by PICS in ICU survivors; (2) the mental component of PICS negatively affects the QoL of ICU survivors; (3) a high prevalence of PICS and moderate prevalence of PICS-F and (4) strain-related symptoms and sleep disorders as the most affected dimensions by PICS-F in ICU family members. Relevant differences in QoL domains such as mobility, pain, discomfort and disability were observed among the ICU survivors with PICS. In 2017, Hodgson and colleagues reported a moderate or severe disability in survivors of critical illness.15 Similar results were obtained in our review. In the literature, it is described how long periods of immobility can negatively affect disability after ICU discharge.15 Interestingly, the predictors of disability included a history of anxiety/ depression.15 This review focuses on the three dimensions of PICS, but the psychological sequelae are described in the literature as PICS without considering the cognitive and physical domains.18 In 2017, Makinen and colleagues reported a high prevalence of persistent pain in ICU survivors.54 The same result was described in our review. Our review shows that the mental component of PICS negatively affects the QoL of ICU survivors. As the literature describes, patients with severe mental health problems have a lower quality of life than the general population.55,56 Patients with mental health problems find it harder to accomplish many of their daily chores, such as washing and dressing, reducing self-confidence.56 In 2020, Berghöfer and colleagues assessed QoL in patients with severe mental illness.56 The authors observed that patients with anxiety disorders and depressive symptoms reported lower Qol scores.56 Similar findings were obtained in the studies included in the review.38,39,43 Guideline on multimodal rehabilitation for patients with post-intensive care syndrome by Renner reported that psychological interventions, such as ICU diary, can counteract PICS's psychological sequelae such as anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress.25 ICU diaries are essential non-pharmacological interventions written by nurses, therapists, or family members to record events about the period that critically ill patients usually cannot remember.57 Our results showed that the PICS prevalence lies in an extensive range between 43% and 96%. The studies in our review included ICU survivors discharged from different types of ICUs with varying admissions to the ICU. A recent systematic review describes that ICU admissions, such as emergency admission and ICU type, are considered risk factors for the onset of PICS symptoms.4 Indeed, the ICU survivors discharged from general and medical/ surgical ICUs have a PICS prevalence between 43% and 54%.36,40,49 That percentage has a sharp increase in those ICU survivors discharged from COVID-19 ICUs (90%),45 with a further rise in ICU survivors discharged from trauma ICUs (96%).35 A recent systematic review with meta-analysis describes that negative ICU experience and delirium are important risk factors for the onset of PICS.4 Our result showed an extensive range of prevalence of PICS. Furthermore, Bottom-Tanzer et al. reported a high prevalence of ICU delirium (prevalence = 81%)35 compared with other studies, including those which measure ICU delirium. Moreover, the severity of critical illness appears to be an independent risk factor for the onset of ICU delirium.58,59 Six out of 19 studies measured ICU delirium. Bottom-Tanzer et al. found the highest range in the survey, with a higher prevalence of PICS than in other included studies. Bottom-Tanzer et al. did not study the relationship between PICS and ICU delirium, but we hypothesize that it may have influenced onset. Therefore, future research should describe how these phenomena interact with each other and ICU survivors’ outcomes. The prevalence of PICS symptoms varies depending on the areas involved, such as cognitive, physical and mental status. ICU survivors with PICS may develop impairment in one or more domains. BottomTanzer et al. reported that in trauma ICU survivors, PICS developed in 34.4% (n = 24) with one criterion. At the same time, it decreased among ICU survivors with two or more standards,35 in COVID-19 survivors, this result increased by up to 90%.41,42 Cognitive impairment was a key component of PICS and was referred to as a more permanent condition60,61 in ICU survivors. Several studies in our systematic review showed a correlation between cognitive impairment and anxiety, depression and PTSD.35,38,46 Critical illness and intensive care treatment are associated with long-term cognitive impairment.11 This decline could cause significant problems in survivors' daily life and professional settings, such as memory, visual construction, processing speed and executive functioning.62 Furthermore, ICU patients experiencing anxiety and depression need more intensive health care than usual to accomplish activities of daily living.63 In 2022, Smith and Rahman observed that these sensations were increased by feelings of isolation, fear and dehumanization, which would justify the relationship with the psychiatric sequelae of the PICS area after discharge.64 A fundamental component for reducing PICS is the introduction of family members in the care process of ICU survivors.49 Furthermore, ICU relatives will experience various burdens attributable to PICS-F.19 Several family members who provided care for critically ill survivors report that it was somewhat difficult to pay for basic needs such as food, housing, medical care and heating, thus creating anxiety and depression.65,66 Our results show that ICU relatives experienced sleep disorders with PICS-F. Previous studies described that relatives with sleep disorders had moderate to severe depression and anxiety.26 The cause could be the patient's concern about vigilance activity during the night, which caused some anxiety.22,67 In 2003, Mahoney defined vigilance as the continuous supervision by relatives of their patients' activities.67 This activity consists of five phases: supervision, protective intervening, anticipating, always on duty and being there.67 Vigilant relatives considered themselves ‘on duty’ even when they weren't ‘doing stuff’, explaining the moderate to severe depression and anxiety among relatives.67 GRAVANTE ET AL. 819 14785153, 2024, 4, Downloaded from  by Aix-Marseille Universitaet, Wiley Online Library on [17/01/2026]. See the Terms and Conditions ( on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License The literature described how intensive treatment changes relationships within the family, with negative repercussions on the quality of sleep for relatives.26 After intensive treatment, ICU survivors cannot be fully independent at discharge.63 Our results describe how PICS negatively affects mobility, personal care, usual activities and pain/discomfort. Several factors can negatively impact the QoL by creating dependence in daily activities, such as older age, male sex, ICU delirium, illness severity and duration of mechanical ventilation.68 ICU admission is an experience that makes a difference to patients. Some ICU survivors have fragmented memories; others remembered the darkness, were unable to speak and had a severe illness and could not get out of bed.69 Memories are foundational to our experience and can often be influenced by ICU survivors.70 Recently, Cohen and Kahana developed a theory on how episodic memory patterns re-establish themselves from context, and memories form associations with the contexts in which they are encoded, including emotional valence and arousal.71 Acute care admission is a period that significantly impacts survivors and family members. Feeling useless when the death of a family member could become a real possibility is one of the feelings that relatives of ICU survivors experience.69 The quality assessment of the included studies was good. Only one study scored low, while most of the included studies scored over 70%, confirming good methodological quality. Recently, Wang et al. and Jeong et al. developed specific tools for detecting PICS, but we are unaware of any tools for PICS-F.8,10 4.1 | Limitations This review has several limitations. Our results were based on studies not using a specific PICS or PICS-F detection tool. In 2010, the SCCM defined PICS as new impairments in ICU survivors in the physical, cognitive and mental components.21 PICS was detected according to the SCCM model, detecting the ICU survivors' central disturbances.21 The researcher detected each disorder with a specific scale, but the long-term outcomes of ICU survivors are numerous. Even though we used a rigorous search and screening strategy, considering that the definition of PICS encompasses extensive domains, our search strategy may not have detected all related studies. Furthermore, we purposely focused only on the mental component of PICS because we were interested in evaluating mental aspects underestimated in ICU survivors and their relatives, providing a vision of the humanization of after-discharge care. Given the clinical complexity of the survivors, not all are detectable, leading to bias.36 In addition, the tools used were not always specific to ICU survivors. Another limitation is that we could consider observational studies only, except for one RCT. This is probably because the topic is relatively new in the literature, especially with respect to the relatives of the ICU survivors. Indeed, only five studies on PICS-F were identified in this systematic review. Therefore, few RCTs studied interventions aimed at these two populations.53 The review exclusion criteria restricting the studies to those in English only and the lack of meta-analysis are limitations. 4.2 | Implications for practice and further research This review has several implications. The literature describes the approaches to minimize PICS and PICS-F.72 The PICS clinic is an environment where critical care survivors are assessed through a psychiatric assessment, including self-assessment modules to test physical, cognitive and mental symptoms.35 PICS and PICS-F are serious and outstanding issues that strongly impact cost and are measured in terms of time for disability, health care costs, financial stress, mortality and potentially preventable readmission.73,74 Specific tools for detecting PICS would provide a more accurate estimate of the phenomenon, helping nurses to identify the ICU survivors who need treatment. Future research is expected to focus on using standardized tools to detect PICS and PICS-F in specific environments, such as PICS clinics, as a common activity for critical care nurses. Critical care nurses are essential in developing and implementing follow-up treatments. They play leadership, staffing and developing roles in different post-ICU services.26 As per Renner et al.,25 the latest PICS rehabilitation guidelines state that professional support is needed during the follow-up care; in particular, the role of nurses in ICU is fundamental in writing and reading along with survivors and their relatives the ICU diaries, as part of the aftercare treatment, in order to obtain better outcomes such as deeper comprehension of the ICU stay, effective coping, improvement of social relationships. Specific tools for detecting PICS would provide a more accurate estimate of the syndrome, helping nurses to identify the ICU survivors who need treatment. Furthermore, because so little has been found on PICS-F and ICU relatives, future research is expected to focus on this population as there is a gap in literature about the identification of this phenomenon through proper tools; also, there are very few interventions towards this population as only one RCT has been found.53 Finally, more research is needed on using standardized tools to detect PICS and PICS-F in specific environments, such as PICS clinics, as a common activity for critical care nurses. 5 | CONCLUSION PICS and PICS-F are common multidimensional cognitive, physical and mental phenomena. The authors investigated each PICS area separately from the others, and not all areas were investigated in some studies. Future studies should focus on standardized tools that detect PICS and PICS-F in all areas. They are often associated with elevated levels of anxiety and depression. In contrast, an increased anxiety level in ICU survivors is associated with increased anxiety in family members, who experience strain-related symptoms and sleep disorders. Early recognition and timely identification of these syndromes must be guaranteed by nurses, by enforcing multidisciplinary follow-up post-ICU services, where critical care nurses can develop and implement specific interventions, in order to improve survivors’ and relatives’ outcomes.

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript guidelines for palliative care in the ED state that all seriously ill patients should receive primary palliative care concurrently with their life-sustaining treatment (LST) . The practice of palliative care in the ED may decrease patients’ symptom burden, improve access to needed services, reduce hospital length of stay, enhance care at the end of life, decrease the number of undesired ICU admissions, and orchestrate psychosocial support for the family . Goals-of-care conversations (GOCC), which explore a patient’s quality of life, views, and priorities within the context of medical treatment, may increase the likelihood that a patient’s end-of-life care preferences are known and followed . Most of the work involving palliative care in the ED involves older adults with preexisting life-limiting conditions, such as incurable cancer . Less is known about the impact of early palliative care for patients with severe acute brain injury (SABI), including stroke, traumatic brain injury (TBI), and hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy after cardiac arrest. Patients with SABI face a sudden threat to their life and personhood  and a high degree of prognostic uncertainty in terms of morbidity and mortality, especially in the hyperacute setting . Many of these patients, or more accurately their family members, in the ED are immediately confronted with choices regarding intubation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), endovascular thrombectomy, decompressive hemicraniectomy, or invasive intracranial pressure monitoring. These are complex medical decisions that must be made in a short amount of time and often involve additional intricacies, such as transfers to larger academic centers or admissions to a neuro-ICU. For the last decade, there has been an increased focus on the integration of palliative care into the practice of neurology . The “neuropalliative care approach,” recognizes the unique palliative care needs of patients with neurologic disease and their families. This multidisciplinary, multidimensional approach to symptom relief, psychosocial support, and end-of-life care can be applied to patients with neurological illness presenting to the ED (Table 1). We describe three different roles that emergency medicine (EM) clinicians are uniquely poised to fill in order to provide comprehensive primary neuropalliative care to patients that starts in the ED: the stage setter, the spokesperson, and the screener (Table 2). This review serves two purposes: (1) to describe roles for EM clinicians and (2) to provide context for neuro-ICU clinicians about what neuropalliative care their patients may receive prior to arriving to the neuro-ICU and how the practice of neuropalliative care beginning in the ED ultimately benefits their patients. The Stage Setter The role of the stage setter is to prepare the family for what is ahead by having an initial GOCC. When a patient presents with SABI, EM clinicians are typically the first to talk with and “break bad news” to the patient’s family members. In this role, EM clinicians take on a large responsibility as they start establishing trust and expectations with the family. Fortunately, there are established frameworks for breaking bad news, such as the SPIKES protocol , the ABCDE mnemonic , and the use of a “headline” , which can help guide the stage setter. Regardless of the model that is used, the general message to the family is that their loved one suffered a brain injury and their hospitalization will likely be long, with an expected level of recovery that is uncertain. Messaging also aims to orient Hendershot and Ouchi Page 2 Neurocrit Care. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2025 October 03. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript the families to the unique aspects of neurocritical illness, such as prognostic uncertainty, unpredictable nature of an ICU course, involvement of multiple health care teams, and roles of supportive care resources (e.g., palliative care, social work, and spiritual care). The language used by EM clinicians to convey the patient’s condition to the family can be passed along to the neuro-ICU clinicians so that they may be able to use the same phrasing or course correct as needed. Use of consistent language may enhance the family’s understanding of the patient’s condition and also demonstrates seamless care transitions from the ED to the ICU. “Setting the stage” also includes encouraging family members to begin formulating the patient’s values and preferences and how their past experiences may relate to their current situation without discussing the patient’s prognosis. In older adults, collecting information regarding their baseline physical and cognitive function, as well as perceived quality of life, is especially important. Older adult ICU survivors experience a significant decline in their functional status over the year following their admission, especially if they already had an impaired functional baseline . Although sharing a prognosis is ideally avoided in the ED, experts suggest that if clinicians discuss prognosis with a patient’s family members, it is important to acknowledge the uncertainty associated with SABI . Guidelines recently published by the Neurocritical Care Society regarding neuroprognostication for patients in a coma following cardiac arrest  or critically ill from an intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH)  or moderate and severe TBI  recommend not beginning to assess prognostic factors for at least 72 h after the injury. All three guidelines endorse the use of all indicated medical and surgical interventions within this time frame, unless the patient is imminently dying from their injury or they have clear documentation stating they do not want to receive any life-prolonging interventions . Therefore, we recommend that the focus of this initial GOCC not be on making any large immediate decisions regarding withholding/withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment (WWLST), including CPR, unless clear and well-established goals to focus on comfortdirected care already exist. Given this recommendation, we also advise against hospital policies that require EM clinicians to establish code status prior to admitting the patient, as the prognostic uncertainty of neurological emergencies often makes this consistent practice inappropriate. When having GOCC, EM clinicians tend to be more focused on asking for preferences regarding specific procedures, such as intubation and CPR, potentially misleading patients/surrogates rather than first eliciting a patient’s values and then developing a treatment plan that best aligns with the patient’s preferences . The perceived length of time required to explore a patient’s values was reported as a potential barrier to a preference-based GOCC in the ED . We do not expect that the entire conversation can be completed in the ED and are instead advocating that EM clinicians simply start the preferences-based conversation with the patient’s family members in order to encourage them to think about the patient’s qualities and prepare them for their continued conversations with the neuro-ICU, neurology, and neurosurgical teams. By initiating the GOCC, EM clinicians will allow neuro-ICU clinicians to demonstrate the understanding of patients’ baseline function, perceived quality of life, and values and goals for medical care elicited by EM clinicians. By seamlessly continuing the GOCC, family members will feel heard and understood from the first day of their neuro-ICU stay. Hendershot and Ouchi Page 3 Neurocrit Care. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2025 October 03. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript As the stage setter, the EM clinicians can provide emotional support to the surrogates. Family members face several unique psychosocial challenges, such as coming to terms with the significant prognostic uncertainty; unaddressed physical needs, such as housing and food; and a lack of consistent compassion, communication, and messaging from their health care team . Social workers and spiritual care providers can supply the families with their invaluable resources and insights. Providing initial support will help establish a strong relationship between the clinicians and the surrogates. It is critical that any psychosocial needs of the family that are identified in the ED be passed on to the neuro-ICU team to address these needs up front in the neuro-ICU. Finally, although the stage setter has the opportunity to develop trust between the health care team and the family, it is also important to note there is a risk of creating irreversible distrust. This can occur by providing misinformation regarding the patient’s prognosis, being overly adamant about obtaining a patient’s code status, offering or withholding treatment options that would be better introduced by other clinicians (such as the placement of an external ventricular drain or the initiation of hemodialysis), or insisting on continuing the GOCC with family members who are highly distressed after the “breaking bad news” portion of the conversation. It is important for the EM clinicians to be candid about any tension that may have arisen between the EM team and the family so that the neuro-ICU team knows what to specifically address in an attempt to rebuild any lost trust. Therefore, the role of stage setter is a large responsibility that would demand specific training in primary palliative care and communication skills in every EM residency. The Spokesperson As the patient’s spokesperson, EM clinicians are responsible for advocating guideline- and goal-concordant care while preventing underuse or overuse of LST. Overly pessimistic neuroprognostication may result in LST not being offered or declined by the patient or family members and may lead to potential underuse of LST . Conversely, for patients for whom LST, within the context of an uncertain prognosis, is clearly not within their GOC based on previously stated or documented directives, admission to the neuro-ICU or transfer to a tertiary care center may be inappropriate (i.e., potential overuse) . To succeed in this role, EM clinicians must be aware of the factors and biases that affect the decision to pursue the initiation of LST, continuation of LST, or WWLST . As stated previously, current neuroprognostication guidelines for patients with SABI recommend that all interventions be pursued in the acute phase of injury, unless the treatments are inconsistent with the patient’s previously stated goals . However, the decision to WWLST in the ED has been justified for a variety of medical reasons, such as a lack of improvement following initial treatment, a belief that the patient’s injury is irreversible, or an expected level of recovery that is not consistent with the patient’s minimally acceptable quality of life . The use of a medical justification for the WWLST of patients with SABI would ideally be avoided in the ED, as there is too much prognostic uncertainty in the hyperacute setting. Instead, we recommend that in the role of spokesperson, the EM clinicians advocate for guideline-concordant care, after gathering relevant information from the family, and make a recommendation regarding the use of Hendershot and Ouchi Page 4 Neurocrit Care. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2025 October 03. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript further LST within the context of the patient’s stated goals in conjunction with the neuroICU, neurosurgical, and neurology clinicians. In fact, if a medical justification is being used for the decision to WWLST in the ED, it is appropriate for EM clinicians to advocate for a multidisciplinary team huddle prior to speaking to the patient’s family about a treatment plan. One approach to offering this initial treatment plan and preventing the underuse of LST when the patient’s prognosis or values are uncertain is to introduce the concept of a timelimited trial (TLT) of LST . Although initiating a TLT is traditionally considered the ICU clinicians’ responsibility, introducing the concept of a TLT in the ED is an important tool for the spokesperson to combat their own bias, and that of their consultants, to be influenced by a premature neuroprognostication. By introducing a TLT in the ED, EM clinicians can help set the expectations with the family and allow them to formulate their GOC while the TLT is occurring. EM clinicians can take the following precautions when introducing the concept of a TLT: clearly communicate prognostic uncertainty to the family and that a range of outcomes are possible, which the intensivists will further clarify, and defer to the ICU team regarding the discussion of indicators of clinical improvement and deterioration and regarding the time frame for rediscussing GOC after arrival to the ICU. Furthermore, given the complexity of these treatment decisions, any initiation of a TLT is best with a team approach consisting of bidirectional communication among the multidisciplinary team of EM, neuro-ICU, neurology, and neurosurgery clinicians. As they will be the team providing the continued care, it is best if the neuro-ICU team is present for the conversation introducing the concept of a TLT to the family so that there is continuity for the plan to be in place. A high-level of collaboration might not be available for every patient in the ED. However, we propose it as a goal when considering a TLT. Introducing a TLT may also be appropriate for some patients whose overall goal is comfort-focused but who have a potentially reversible condition. For example, it may be appropriate to temporarily reverse a patient’s DNI code status and intubate them for endovascular thrombectomy if there is a chance to decrease or eliminate the degree of disability the patient will experience . Others have suggested that in cases in which the patient’s values and preferences are unclear, the provision of potentially unwanted aggressive care may be ethically justified in some emergency or ICU settings, as long as it is provided with a clear offer of a TLT and continued, skillful conversation . For example, if a patient with a TBI is unable to participate in a GOCC due to their injuries and no family members are identified, it is likely appropriate to proceed with a decompressive hemicraniectomy to prevent herniation until a GOCC can occur. As illustrated by the examples in this paragraph, TLTs introduced in the ED acknowledge prognostic uncertainty and the fluidity of a patient’s GOC in the hyperacute setting and allow for both aspects to evolve as a patient’s clinical picture becomes clearer. This is an ongoing area of research . In the opposite aspect of the spokesperson role, EM clinicians can also prevent the overuse of LST by advocating for the avoidance of procedures, treatments, admissions, and transfers for patients in whom pursuing LST would not be within their GOC, even if prognostic uncertainty exists. Patients with SABI are often transferred to larger academic centers for further evaluation or definitive treatment of their condition. However, a transfer to another care facility may not be within a patient’s GOC and could potentially be separating Hendershot and Ouchi Page 5 Neurocrit Care. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2025 October 03. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript a critically ill patient from their family members. Therefore, initiating such a transfer will ideally include a GOCC in order to determine that the procedure that the patient is potentially being transferred for or the transfer itself is within the patient’s stated GOC. A retrospective study of patients who died within 72 h of transfer to a large tertiary care center found that only 10% of patients had a documented GOCC prior to being transferred . When having this conversation, it is important to note that not all patients who are transferred for higher levels of care receive an intervention and that not all patients benefit from being transferred . Informing the patient and/or their family members that, in some cases, the transfer is just for further evaluation and for help formulating a prognosis is also important, as families may not want a transfer for those reasons and may not require further clarity on the patient’s prognosis to make treatment decisions. As with any LST, a transfer to a tertiary care center provides the patient with a chance for improvement that they may otherwise not get and may still end with a comfort-focused pathway if the desired outcome is not achieved . Presenting the transfer to the decision maker in a comprehensive manner, including the downstream effects of the transfer, has the potential to prevent transfers that are not consistent with patient preferences and could save the family significant emotional and economic distress, in addition to ensuring that the patient is receiving goal-concordant care. One recommendation would be for accepting neuro-ICU clinicians to ask the referring EM clinician if a preliminary GOCC has occurred and if they believe the transfer is concordant with their treatment preferences. The Screener Whereas the stage setter and spokesperson roles are more applicable to patients presenting to the ED acutely with a life-threatening neurological illness, the screener is suggested as a role for EM clinicians to assess the neuropalliative care needs of all patients presenting to the ED. As much of this review has focused on patients with SABI, we will discuss the screener role as it pertains to stable patients who are at risk of presenting to the ED in extremis in the future. In this distinctive role, EM clinicians are the assessors of gaps in the neuropalliative care needs of patients with neurodegenerative diseases and patients with medical histories, such as prior strokes or epilepsy, that put them at risk of acute neurological decompensation in the future. For the first part of this role, EM clinicians can screen patients for ongoing neuropalliative care needs in relation to gaps in addressing their GOC, pain, nutritional, and functional status during brief conversations initiated through the use of serious illness conversation triggers. Subsequently, they can make immediate medication adjustments or a referral to their outpatient clinician, as appropriate. For the second part of the role, the intention is to elicit the values, preferences, and treatment goals of patients who have survived severe neurological emergencies to share their insights regarding their future care if their condition were to recur or a new emergency were to develop. It may be important to have this conversation documented before the patient is in a situation in which they are incapacitated, but knowledge of that information is paramount. In general, the screener plays a supportive role to the patient’s primary care physician or to the patient’s primary neurologist by ensuring that any gaps in the patient’s neuropalliative care have been addressed. Ideally, EM clinicians are building off prior conversations and management that the patient has had with their primary clinicians. However, as patients Hendershot and Ouchi Page 6 Neurocrit Care. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2025 October 03. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript with chronic serious neurologic illness frequently present to the ED for management of their chronic conditions, the need for this role is likely increasing. Patients with neurodegenerative disorders are at risk of being functionally dependent as their disease progresses but have low rates of documented GOCC . Additionally, one retrospective study of health system administrative data found that nearly two thirds of patients with a neurodegenerative disease had at least one ED visit in the last year of their life . Patients with chronic neurological conditions presenting to the ED for pain, nutritional problems, or gait instability are often better treated on an outpatient basis , assuming that the patient has the ability to follow up with a clinician. There is a potential need and opportunity for EM clinicians to address gaps in patients’ GOCC and symptom management related to their neurodegenerative disease as they near the end of life. In the screener role, EM clinicians will identify serious illness conversation triggers in order to initiate a discussion that reveals the patient’s neuropalliative care needs. Although these triggers will need to be defined for the practice of neuropalliative care in the ED, several have been suggested for the general practice of neuropalliative care . Events such as numerous hospitalizations; new weight loss and comorbidities; and changes in cognitive, mobility, and functional status have been proposed as potential triggers . Research is needed in order to establish serious illness conversation triggers specific to patients at risk of and with neurological emergencies as well as steps to meet the identified needs. An additional opportunity for the screener exists with patients who have a medical history of stroke or other conditions that put them at risk of presenting to the ED with a neurologic emergency requiring neuro-ICU admission in the future. Each year, approximately 185,000 patients experience recurrent strokes . When patients present with a recurrent stroke, they may be too incapacitated to express their treatment preferences. These patients may also have invaluable insights regarding their future care based on prior hospitalizations. Despite the importance of GOCC with this patient group, less than half of stroke survivors presenting to the stroke clinic had completed advance directives and even less had EMS documentation of these directives in one single-center study . Although three quarters of the patients had some form of GOCC, more than half preferred to have additional dialogue . Therefore, for this group of patients, we propose the use of a serious illness conversation trigger based on their medical history, such as stroke, seizures, progressive neurologic disease, or frequent falls. For instance, upon admitting or discharging a patient with frequent presentations for seizures, the EM clinician can ask the patient about their preferences and values that may be applicable to a decision to intubate the patient if any of their future presentations warranted such an intervention. Successful screeners have the potential to provide patients with the end-of-life care that they prefer by ensuring that their values and preferences are clearly documented in the chart before the patient presents for a life-threatening condition. Therefore, the neuro-ICU clinicians could use this information in the future to develop a patient-centered, goal-concordant treatment plan for the patient. More research is needed to determine whether fulfillment of this role is feasible for EM clinicians given the time constraints often present in the ED. Hendershot and Ouchi Page 7 Neurocrit Care. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2025 October 03. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Conclusions Expanding the practice of neuropalliative care into the ED may be one of the next steps to ensuring the consistent delivery of high-quality, patient-centered care to patients with neurological emergencies, and more research and educational efforts are required. Its successful integration may ease the transition for patients to the neuro-ICU. In an effort to encourage EM clinicians to practice primary neuropalliative care, we have described three succinct roles: the stage setter, the spokesperson, and the screener. By combining the aspects of these three distinct roles, EM clinicians can help establish trust between the family members of patients and their care team, advocate against the underuse of LST in situations of inappropriately premature neuroprognostication and against the overuse of LST in situations in which the patient has clear directives contrary to the use of LST, and address the gaps in the management of patients with neuropalliative care needs who present to the ED. As communication between EM clinicians and the inpatient teams is paramount to each role, systems, such as sections in the written documentation or verbal handoff that are dedicated to the discussion of GOCC, need to be established for these three proposed frameworks to be successful. The practice of neuropalliative care in the ED requires further investigation before targeted interventions, perhaps incorporating the three roles outlined here, can be developed.',\n",
       " 'Dying in the Intensive Care Unit: A Candle Vigil Using Illustrations Elizabeth K.N. Johnson, RN, BSN, and Eelco F.M. Wijdicks, MD, PhD Abstract With death and dying in intensive care units, there should be bereavement support for families. We propose placing an illustration of a candle on the door of an unresponsive dying patient, with additional illustrations of votive candles at the nurses’ station opposite to the door as a neutral way of identifying these rooms with patients who transitioned to comfort care or who have died. The candle illustrations encourage staff members to modify their words, silence themselves, and reﬂect. After a 1-year tryout in the neurointensive care unit with a strong positive experience for staff and families, it can be perceived as a symbol of tranquility. n Mayo Clin Proc Inn Qual Out 2018;2(4):378-381 T he staff of intensive care units (ICUs) recurrently deal with death and dying, but families bear the heavy burden. This realization has led medical institutions to develop bereavement-support programs for families. The common occurrence of unexpected sudden death from catastrophic brain injury is heartbreaking for all involved and makes effective bereavement support essential in neurointensive care units.1,2 In fact, bereavement-associated posttraumatic stress disorder occurs more frequently in families of patients who die in the ICU and, according to studies performed in the neurointensive care unit, persists up to 6 months in 30% of family members who participated in decision making.3 Within the room of the unresponsive patient, bereavement support involves agreedupon spiritual ceremonials and guidance. But outside the patient room, the only visible display may be a closed curtain, a do-notenter (stop) sign when the patient has died, or just a verbal admonition by a staff nurse― not infrequently at the last moment. Motivated by an imperative to do better, we propose placing an illustration of a candle on the door of an unresponsive, dying patient, with additional illustrations of candles at the nurses’ station opposite to the door. This is a simple and, in our view, solemn and neutral way of identifying rooms in which a patient is dying. The candle illustration on a closed door helps to set this room apart from the adjacent hurried, often loud ICU environment. The signage is intended not only to identify comfort care patients but also to encourage staff members to adapt their words and actions accordingly. CANDLE SYMBOLISM The candledsince its invention as burning wax approximately 3000 years BCdhas evolved into a symbol of light in the darkness, a remembrance, a prayer for the dead, and celebration of major religious holidays. The candle functions in bereavement to inspire reﬂection and tribute. It is prominently used in vigils. People often spontaneously place candles in front of houses of recently deceased public ﬁgures or to commemorate deaths caused by natural disasters or acts of terrorism. Major world religions have used the candle with overlapping meanings. The candle in the Roman Catholic Church signiﬁes the divine savior (Lumen Christi). Ages ago, candles were placed in the hands of the dying, and the burning light was a symbol of Christ whom the departed went to meet.4 Believers in Judaism kindle lights to usher in the Sabbath and festivals, and it is customary to light a candle on the anniversary of a death (Yahrzeit) of a close loved one. The National Holocaust Museum has a candle room for remembrance. Muslims do not use candles at funerals, but candlelight vigil is not explicitly From the Neurosciences Intensive Care Unit, Saint Marys Hospital, Rochester, MN.

Moreover, candles decorate areas with light during Ramadan (“Month of Light”). Candles are lit in front of Buddhist shrines or statues as signs of respect and are commonly used at funerals. Many Hindus incorporate ﬁre in ceremonies that they consider sacred. Diwali (Festival of Lights) symbolizes the triumph of good over evil and light over darkness.5 In the modern age, the symbolism of a burning candle is strong and demands serenity. Candles encountered in large numbers cause people to reﬂect for a moment. For many of us, it requires little explanation. It cannot be expected to offend even if used in peaceful demonstrations. OUR ADAPTATION OF THE CANDLE To overcome the usual restrictions against burning candles in a hospital room or ICU, we designed illustrations of a number of candles in coordination with Mayo Clinic Brand Strategy and Creative Studio Department (\\x022018 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research). We placed an illustration of a single burning candle on the door of the patient’s room and illustrations of votive candles on the nurses’ station in plastic placeholders opposite or near the room of the patient (Figures 1 and 2). Triggers for placement were a decision to withdraw support in a patient with irrevocable brain injury or in patients designated as potential organ donors according to brain-death or cardiac-death protocols. The placement of an order set to withdraw support was used as a trigger to place the illustrations, but the nursing staff additionally conﬁrmed this order with physicians to avoid misunderstandings. Families were notiﬁed and gave verbal consent for the placement of illustrations. The illustrations remained in place until the family members had said their last goodbyes and left the unit. The door cards were Oxivir wiped, stored, and reused. Our preliminary trial lasted for a year. THE RESPONSE The response was immediately supportive. Staff present in the unit rapidly understood the signiﬁcance of the candle and toned down their conversation while passing the room. Many initially asked what the candle was for but quickly appreciated the symbolism after receiving an explanation. Nursing staff remained motivated to use the illustrations after the pilot study ended. The placeholders did not obstruct administrative trafﬁc. Family members were likewise very appreciative―the spouse of one patient was so moved by the site of the candle door card that she requested to take it home in remembrance of her husband. Others have remarked that the simplicity of the gesture positively impacted the death experience by promoting a more personalized atmosphere and dignity. No negative experiences were identiﬁed.

CANDLE ILLUSTRATIONS IN THE INTENSIVE CARE UNIT Mayo Clin Proc Inn Qual Out n December 2018;2(4):378-381 n   379 CONCLUSION The vast number of staff members caring for a patient coupled with the fast-paced, highly technical environment of the ICU can adversely―albeit unintentionally―affect the profoundly personal end-of-life experience for patients and their loved ones. Our neurointensive care unit admits many patients with acute catastrophic brain injury, but in only a fraction―approximately 5 patients per month―the devastating ﬁndings and agreed-upon futility of care results in withdrawal of care. When walking through the unit, ICU staff and visiting family members may have to identify which room has a dying (or deceased patient). We have also been struck by the impersonal―but necessary―protocolized management of the deceased (ie, closed curtains and cold stop signs). Our experience with the additional placement of candle illustrations has been very satisfactory. These illustrations may not only bring down noise levels, often related to staff conversations,6,7 but also serve as a part of holistic care to patients whose lives are drawing to an end. Families and all health care workers with different beliefs (or no belief) appear to appreciate the symbolism of the candle placed outside the room of the dying patient, but it only goes so far to assuage the grief. We do not pretend this placement of candle illustrations alleviates the bereavement process, but we do not envision any negative effect. Despite an increasingly secular world, religious beliefs continue to play a role in managing endof-life care, and the candle illustrations will afﬁrm its symbolism for many. We perceive the candle illustration as a neutral symbol that nevertheless respects faith-based and other interpretations. The candle illustration should not take away hope for a miracle in some family members even after the decision is made to go to comfort measures. The placard should be used only for those patients who transitioned to comfort care and after full agreement to withdrawal of support but also with physicians anticipating early demise. Our trial was performed in the neurointensive care unit, but we do not foresee concerns when candles are used in other types of ICUs. Its continuing use after the patient is moved out of the ICU to a regular ward may be considered. Our illustrations have a noticeable color scheme and are large enough for easy notice. The alternative or additional use of batteryoperated candles may be physically more difﬁcult, but we have allowed them in patients’ rooms at the families’ request. Candles have long symbolized part of the Mayo Clinic model of care. The Sisters of Saint Francis, who founded Saint Marys Hospital and welcomed people from all faiths, believed in prayer as a key component of care. Dr William J. Mayo, who came from a different tradition, respected and honored the Sisters’ devotion to patients. He often told the Sisters, “I’ll pay for the candles, and you light them.” FIGURE 2.

MAYO CLINIC PROCEEDINGS: INNOVATIONS, QUALITY & OUTCOMES 380 Mayo Clin Proc Inn Qual Out n December 2018;2(4):378-381 n   The sight of a candle often causes individuals to pause, silence themselves, and reﬂect. In spite of the immense religious symbolism associated with candles, they additionally evoke peace, quiet, and tranquility in the absence of a belief system. Candles are thus both a neutral and universal symbol. In the unit, the door placards and nurses’ station signs serve as a visual reminder in a simple and discreet manner that a patient has shifted from life-sustaining interventions to end-of-life care.

       " 'Introduction Patients admitted to the Neurocritical Care Unit (NCCU) may have the potential for unmet palliative care needs given medical complexity, communication barriers directly with patients, and prognostic uncertainty coupled with the acute and sometimes devastating debility of the disease1. Data shows that palliative needs may be present in up to 62% of patients admitted to the NCCU, with large ischemic strokes or intracerebral hemorrhage requiring mechanical ventilation being most common and particularly vulnerable.2-5 However, data from the National Inpatient Sample that included 395,411 stroke patients, reported palliative care encounters in only 6.2% of patients.6 Furthermore, both patients admitted to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and their family members may suffer from new or worsening physical, cognitive or mental health distress, beyond the acute hospitalization phase known as “Post-intensive care syndrome” or “Post-intensive care syndrome-family”.7-8 Thus, in recent years, palliative care collaboration with the intensive care teams has become integrated into practice for high-quality, comprehensive care across many intensive care settings. Speciﬁc triggers for palliative consultations reported in the literature within this population include intracerebral hemorrhage, mechanical ventilation, clarifying goals of care, family support, decision making, discharge planning and communication.4,9-10 Proactive multi-disciplinary measures have shown to improve communication, patient and family centeredness of care, reduced the length of ICU stay, completion of advanced care planning, and overall quality of care in patients with various devastating illnesses.11-18 The overarching goal of palliative care medicine is to focus on goal concordant care, which can further be deﬁned as concentrating on patient centered care, whether that be, curative, rehabilitative, or for comfort. This includes managing physical and psychological symptoms; addressing spiritual, social and cultural needs; improving understanding of disease process; and/or endof-life discussions.19 Integrating early palliative care assessments into patient care can improve a patient’s social support, communication, advance care planning, and satisfaction of the patients and their surrogates with overall quality of life.11-12, 20-21 Our primary objective was to determine if early collaborative care within the NCCU with integration of palliative care consultations was feasible and if it improved understanding, decision-making and emotional support to patients and surrogate decision makers in critically ill stroke patients. Our secondary objective was to evaluate the impact of palliative care support on the development of post-traumatic stress disorder amongst either patients or their surrogate decision makers. Methods This was a prospective study approved by the IRB at our comprehensive stroke center. Patients were recruited and enrolled from February 2019 \\x01 January 2020, with ﬁnal follow up completed in April 2020. The NCCU is a 24-bed closed unit that provides specialized care to critically ill neurosurgical, neurological, and post-operative patients. Study population Inclusion and exclusion criteria All patients admitted to the NCCU with moderate to severe ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke were screened for potential inclusion, regardless of intubation status. Moderate to severe ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke was deﬁned as a patient with a Modiﬁed Rankin Score (mRS) of 3 or above at time of presentation (on a scale of 0 \\x01 6, where 0 has no symptoms, 3 is “Moderate disability. Requires some help, but able to walk unassisted”, and 6 is death), and an NIHSS of 10 or greater. We utilized data extrapolated from the landmark TOAST clinical trial22 to best understand what NIHSS would be consistent with a moderate to severe stroke with disability. Based on this landmark paper, an NIHSS of 16 or greater indicated a strong probability of patient death, while a baseline NIHSS of less than 6 indicated a strong probability of good recovery. Thus, a rounded median between these two values, or a value of 10, was chosen to indicate a moderate to severe disability. The mRS is a validated measure of physical disability, standardly used to assess and evaluate patient’s outcomes after stroke.23 NIHSS was superseded by mRS as an inclusion criterion, as it elucidated the importance of requiring assistance and overall mobility. Furthermore, patients with premorbid baseline deﬁcits of mRS > 2 were excluded from our study and mRS was calculated using the stroke severity on presentation. Patients and caregivers were approached for study enrollment based on the following criteria: age 18 years and above, anticipated admission to the NCCU for greater than 48 hours, NIHSS \\x01 10, mRS \\x01 3, and an identiﬁable surrogate decision maker or legal next of kin with the ability to speak English and consent to participate in the study. Patients were excluded from consideration if they were pregnant, incarcerated, presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage, transitioned to comfort care within 48 hours of admission, admitted to the NCCU after a planned neurosurgical procedure, or lacked an identiﬁable surrogate decision maker or legal next of kin with the ability to speak English and consent to participate in a timely manner. At the time of screening, patients had already been admitted to the NCCU, and thus, most acute emergent ischemic stroke interventions, including administration of 2 H.A. KAMDAR ET AL. intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and mechanical thrombectomy (MT) were already completed. However, if a patient was admitted with a hemorrhagic stroke, an extraventricular drain (EVD) placement, and/ or hemicrianiectomy (HC) may or may not have been done depending on the patient’s clinical presentation. Participant characteristics Participants include patients and their surrogate decision makers. Demographic information included: age, gender, ethnicity, educational status, marital status, and employment status. Clinical data included: patient baseline comorbidities, stroke type (hemorrhagic, ischemic, ischemic with hemorrhagic conversion), degree of stroke severity on admission and discharge based on mRS and National Institute of Stroke Scale (NIHSS), code status on admission and discharge, length of NCCU stay, length of total hospital stay, and discharge disposition. Randomization Once participants were screened and met inclusion and exclusion criteria, they were approached for study enrollment and informed consent. Once consented, they were randomized into either control or intervention arms. Randomization was done en block to allow for equal distribution in both groups and included patients treated by various care providers. Allocation of participants was equally distributed into control and intervention arms with an allocation ratio of 1:1. Intervention and Control Arms In both groups, routine management of ischemic or hemorrhagic strokes, mechanical ventilation, and systemic complications, was performed based on the standard of care deﬁned by the American Stroke Association Guidelines.24 This included all acute or emergent interventions approved by the Federal Drug Administration for ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke including the administration of tPA, MT, EVD placement, and/or HC if indicated. In the control arm, the patient received routine NCCU care with palliative care consultation placed per the discretion of the treating team. In the intervention arm, the patient received early palliative care consultation. This consisted of two meetings, the ﬁrst occurred within 72 hours of admission to the NCCU, and the second one was conducted at, at least, 5-7 days after admission, or prior to discharge. Prior to all palliative interventions, the primary NCCU team had a collaborative and comprehensive discussion with the palliative care team focusing particularly on the understanding of where the patient was in the spectrum of the natural history of disease, and the presence or lack of prognostic indicators at that particular time. During the palliative care consultation, a member of the palliative team assessed the participants and surrogate decision makers palliative care needs using the eight domains of palliative care. Speciﬁc emphasis was placed on patient and/or surrogate decision maker’s understanding of disease process, prognostic awareness, and elements of shared decision-making in collaboration with the NCCU team. The majority of palliative care consultation meetings were conducted with a member of the NCCU team; however, if the team was not present, they were notiﬁed of the salient points of the discussion and if any preferences away from the current care were voiced (for example, the participant wanted to have end of life discussions, change in code status or elected to shift to comfort measures). If these preferences were identiﬁed, further conversations were done with the surrogate decision maker together with both the primary NCCU team and the consultant palliative team. Study instruments & outcomes Study outcomes were assessed through validated surveys given to both groups of participants during the following three-time frames: 1) Time 1: Day 1-3 of admission to the NCCU and if within the intervention arm, prior to the palliative care encounter (in-person), 2) Time 2: Day 5-7 of hospital care or prior to discharge, 3) Time 3: At 3-months post-discharge (phone-call) (Table 2). At time point one and two, three surveys were distributed to participants: Questionnaire on Communication (QoC), Decisional Conﬂict Scale (DCS), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Finally, at time point three, participants were asked to complete the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL- 5). Surveys were ﬁlled by the surrogate decision maker alone, or in conjunction with the patient based on their ability to participate. Questionnaire on Communication (QoC) The Quality of Communication questionnaire is a seventeen-item survey developed from qualitative studies with patients, families and clinicians, in which thirteen items measured two components of communication: general communication (six items) and communication about goals of care (seven items). Items are scored from 0 \\x01 10, with higher scores indicating better communication.25 Decisional conﬂict scale (DCS) The Decisional Conﬂict Scale is a sixteen-point instrument, measuring individual’s perceptions of uncertainty PALLIATIVE INTEGRATION IN CRITICAL STROKE PATIENTS 3 in choosing options and modiﬁable factors contributing to uncertainty, such as feeling uninformed, unclear about personal values, and unsupported decision-making.26 Higher scores indicated higher decisional conﬂict. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale is a fourteenitem assessment with subscales of anxiety and depression that have been validated and reliable amongst surrogates and other trials of behavioral interventions.27-28 Each domain has a score range of 0\\x0121; 0\\x017 = normal; 8\\x0110= borderline abnormal; 11\\x0121 = abnormal, with higher scores indicating higher levels of anxiety and depression. This was measured at three different time frames (twice during hospitalization and once during the 3 month follow up phone survey) to determine, the changes with our intervention. HADS values at 1 week have correlated with symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder 3 months following ICU stay.29 Post-traumatic stress disorder checklist for DSM-5 (PCL- 5) The symptoms of PTSD were assessed using the Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5 by a telephone survey at 3 months post-discharge, i.e., 3 months after the inciting event.30 The PCL-5 is a 20-item selfreport measure that assesses 20 symptoms of PTSD and is used for screening individuals for PTSD. Statistical methods Descriptive statistics were conducted to describe the characteristics and scores of the patient sample overall and stratiﬁed by intervention. Comparisons between groups were performed using two sample t-tests for normally-distributed continuous variables and Mann\\x01Whitney U-tests for non-normally-distributed continuous variables, as well as Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables with small sample sizes. Results were reported as mean and standard deviation and median and interquartile range when appropriate. Linear mixed effects models were conducted to examine the association between intervention and patients’ or surrogate decision maker’s scores at different time points. Individual patients were entered as a random effects term. The models were ﬁt via maximum likelihood estimation using the lme function from the nlme package in R (v3.4.1, R Foundation, Vienna, Austria) and R Studio (v1.0.153, RStudio Inc., Boston, MA). For all analyses, p-values <0.05 were considered statistically signiﬁcant. We decided a priori to conduct four separate models for each of the four scales and include intervention, timepoint if present, and score in each baseline model. We explored the interaction between intervention and timepoint when appropriate (e.g., only for QoC, DCS, and HADS scores). Other variables were added to the model if they had a p value <0.20 for the relationship between the variable and score in a baseline model that also included the intervention and timepoint. We chose not to attempt to perform multivariable modeling using forward and backward selections methods and did not adjust for multiple comparisons using Holm\\x01Bonferroni method due to the inherent limited sample size and degrees of freedom available in this hypothesis-generating study. Results Participant baseline characteristics Of the 431 patients initially screened from 2/4/2019 \\x01 1/5/2020, 106 met initial screening criteria of moderate to severe ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke admitted to the NCCU. Of these 78 were excluded: 41 did not have an identiﬁable surrogate decision maker available to consent or actively participate in the study, 30 declined participation, 6 were participating in another trial which did not allow for multiple study enrollments, and 1 was excluded based on attending preference; leaving 28 consented and enrolled participants. Of the 28 participants, 22 completed the study, and 6 were removed from analysis due to inability to complete pre/post surveys (Fig. 1). Of the 22 participants who completed the study, 11 patients were randomized to each arm. Of the 11 patients within the control arm, none received palliative consultation. Participant characteristics are outlined in Table 1. The majority of all survey responders (n=21/22, 95.45%) within both the control and intervention arms were surrogate decision makers. Only one patient participated in the surveys conducted at 3-month follow up alongside their surrogate decision maker who had previously ﬁlled out surveys during the patient’s hospitalization. The majority of patients were Caucasian (81.82%), experienced an ischemic stroke (59.09%), and had surrogates who had completed at least some college (71.43%). The average patient age was 62.73 (§ 14.93) and an average NIHSS score at admission was 16.18 (Standard Deviation = 7.63). There were no signiﬁcant differences in patient characteristics between the two groups (Table 1). Similarly, baseline characteristics of enrolled surrogate decision makers were largely similar except for a statistically signiﬁcant difference between the education status of the surrogate decision maker, with a higher percentage of advanced degree in the intervention arm (p=0.009). (Table 1). Amongst both groups, eight patients in each arm presented with ischemic strokes, with one each complicated by hemorrhagic conversion; and three with primary intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH). Location of stroke, stroke mechanism, and acute stroke interventions that were performed are outlined in Table 4. Stroke 4 H.A. KAMDAR ET AL. interventions performed included: Intravenous tPA, MT, EVD placement, and/or HC if indicated. Comparison between total survey scores across different time points Survey data across different time points is outlined in Table 2. There were no signiﬁcant differences in the QoC and DCS scores between the groups and across timepoints (Tables 3). There were, however, signiﬁcant differences in the total HADS scores (p=0.043), the anxiety subcomponent of the HADS score (p=0.016) and the PCL-5 scores (p=0.033) (Table 3). There were both marginal and statistically signiﬁcant interactions between intervention and various timepoints for HADS scores (p=0.06 and p=0.028) (Table 3). Additionally, there was statistically signiﬁcant difference in the PCL5-3 scores between intervention arm and control arm groups at 3 months (p=0.018) (Table 3), suggesting that early palliative care assessment may lead to a decrease in anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress experience at three months. Patient discharge disposition and mortality There was no statistical difference between discharge disposition or mortality between both groups. Four patients were discharged to inpatient rehab (IPR) in the control group, as compared to the two in the intervention arm. Six patients were discharged to skilled nursing facility (SNF) in the control group as compared to the ﬁve in the intervention. Both these ﬁndings were not signiﬁcant. Discussion Our study aim was to determine the feasibility of integrating a palliative care assessment earlier in the hospital course to improve communication and goal concordant care. We aimed to characterize the impact of this intervention on patient and surrogate decision maker outcomes such as quality of communication, decision-making, anxiety and depression, and PTSD) using validated tools. Our unadjusted data for total 3-month PCL5 score in patients and surrogates who received palliative care intervention was signiﬁcantly lower compared to standard care. When compared to the standard of care group, patients receiving palliative care reported scores corresponding to less anxiety and depression at three months relative to baseline and immediately after palliative care consultation. These data indicate that palliative care integration may have a long-term beneﬁt in critically ill stroke patients in terms of anxiety, depression, and PTSD. Furthermore, our study did not reveal a statistically signiﬁcant effect on mortality rate when comparing both arms, a salient concern of many providers being cognizant of avoiding self-fulﬁlling prophecies (SFPs) and premature withdrawal of care. This is especially of concern within the NCCU, where biomarkers of prognostication Fig. 1. Participant Screening and Randomization Procedure.

KAMDAR ET AL. are limited and still being studied, and extra caution must be given to avoid SFPs. A randomized control trial conducted in 2014 with a total of 3,124 ICU patients over 14 sites revealed that the NCCU cohort as compared to the medical or surgical cohorts had fewer palliative care consultations, and discussions in prognosis within the ﬁrst 72 hours of ICU stay; however, they also had more DNR orders at time of death, shorter ICU stays, shorter withdrawal time, and overall better family and nursing ratings of quality of dying.31 We believe a key contributor that accounted for lack of signiﬁcant difference in mortality between both groups in our study was due the fact that palliative care team consultation focused on patient and/or surrogate decision maker’s understanding of disease process, prognostic awareness, and elements of shared decision-making in collaboration with the NCCU team, rather than solely on end-of-life discussions. It is also important to note that our results differ from prior report that demonstrated no signiﬁcant beneﬁt from palliative check lists or integration of palliative care measures in a large set of NCCU patients of various diagnostic conditions.5 This may be from the differences in sample size and selection criteria between both studies.

KAMDAR ET AL. also be explained by optimal triggers and timing of palliative care consultations. We believe that patients and their surrogates should receive timely, transparent, individualized, and balanced information on their treatment options. Another consideration is that the intervention arm may have had more structured, comprehensive, and multidisciplinary family meetings as a result of the consultation. Thus, a cohesive and multidisciplinary paradigm is the key to successful and meaningful satisfaction within our patient population. Our study did not identify differences in anxiety, depression, communication, or decisional conﬂict scales during acute hospitalization in either arm, which highlights the challenges patients and surrogate decision makers face in the acute phase of hospitalization, regardless of the approach to plan of care. However, early collaborative palliative care assessment did suggest potential beneﬁt in long-term post-hospitalization mental health. Data on the optimal timing of palliative care intervention and the impact of these interventions on NCCU patients have started to emerge, but much has yet to be described. A better understanding of these outcomes can help guide the timely use of palliative care in the NCCU and reﬁne models for palliative care consultation. Limitations This study has several important limitations. As this was a single center study with a small sample size with unadjusted variables, it was not powered to identify the true impact of early palliative intervention or allow for multivariate analysis. Furthermore, given the limit in population size we remained cautious to make any inference to statistical signiﬁcance or non-signiﬁcance regarding prognostic factors that may have potentially impacted shared decision making. Additionally, phone surveys inherently carry a non-response limitation, which affects the sample size of our three-month follow up surveys. However, this study did prove feasibility of study design, and future study is planned to achieve study power. Despite en block randomization with an allocation ratio of 1:1 to ensure similar baseline characteristics of enrolled participants, there was a statistically signiﬁcant difference between the education status of the surrogate decision makers in each group, with a higher percentage of advanced degrees in the intervention arm. This may be a potential confounder in our results. Another limitation was exclusion of non-English speaking participants which may affect the generalizability of our results. Finally, is also important to note, as the majority of the participants were patient’s surrogate decision makers, our sample was more a representation of the surrogate and indirect representations of the patients scores.

       " \"INTRODUCTION Neurocritical patients admitted to the neurosurgical intensive care unit (NS-ICU) often present with acutely debilitating neurological conditions, stemming from acute ischemic/hemorrhagic stroke, traumatic brain injury, or other non-traumatic brain injuries, such as highly aggressive brain neoplasms 35). While comprehensive statistics on the epidemiology of neurocritical patients in South Korea are currently unavailable, the country is witnessing a surge in traumatic brain injuries 9,32) and vascular events 1,14,19) with the aging population, hinting at a potential rise in the demand for neurocritical care in the future. Concurrently, the socioeconomic burden associated with caring for neurocritical patients is gradually increasing 5,20). Critically ill neurosurgical patients exhibit distinctive features that set them apart from other seriously ill individuals 11,12). Despite intensive treatment, they often face heightened mortality and clinical uncertainty, with outcomes varying significantly. The life-threatening nature of their condition may lead to early death 28), especially post-decision to withdraw life-sustaining interventions, or substantial disability upon survival. Family caregivers, grappling with the patient’s acute neurological changes, encounter challenges in surrogate decision-making and bear a substantial caregiving responsibility 25). Even for those who survive, functional decline may persist. Therefore, there is an urgent need to enhance the quality of life for both neurocritical patients and their caregivers 11). Palliative care is a specialized approach designed to enhance the quality of life for both patients and their families through patient-centered care, involving comprehensive assessment and care planning 30). The application of palliative care varies according to the illness trajectory. In progressive diseases such as cancer, the early integration of palliative care alongside disease treatment has been shown to substantially improve the quality of life for patients and their families. This integration also promotes the appropriate utilization of end-of-life medical care 10). However, the role of palliative care and its effective integration into the treatment of patients with an acute illness trajectory were not well-understood until the introduction of an initiative to enhance the quality of palliative care in ICUs in 2010 31). Since then, as part of the palliative care approach in the ICU, various interventions have been introduced, including decision-making support 3), family support 4,36), and ethics consultation 2,29). These efforts have resulted in positive outcomes, including a notable reduction in distress experienced by ICU patients, their families, and healthcare professionals. Additionally, there has been an increase in patient and family satisfaction 13), coupled with a decrease in the overall length of ICU stay 18,27). Also, recently, the concept of neuro-palliative care has been evolving, addressing the unique needs of patients with neurological conditions 11). While recent research has highlighted the potential significance of facilitating goals of care discussions among those patients 28), particularly those struggling to make independent decisions, the integration of palliative care in the NS-ICU remains undervalued. In South Korea, as in other countries, patients with neurocritical conditions and their families may have significant palliative care needs. Despite the enforcement of the Act on hospice and palliative care and decisions on life-sustaining treatment (LST) for patients at the end of life (hereafter, LST Decisions Act) in 2018 16), hospice palliative services are inaccessible to neurocritical patients admitted to the NS-ICU although those with very limited prospects of recovery or who are brain-dead have been traditionally seen as candidates for end-of-life care. However, from the perspective of extending palliative care beyond end-of-life care to address “living well” rather than merely “dying well,” some opinions suggest that neurosurgical ICU patients, who may face various challenges and needs even with successful treatment, could also be considered appropriate candidates for palliative care. This descriptive study aims to identify the characteristics, palliative care needs, and outcomes of patients referred to palliative care services during admission to the NS-ICU. MATERIALS AND METHODS The study protocol underwent review and received approval from the Institutional Review Board of at Seoul National University Hospital (SNUH) (No. H-2205-180-1331). Informed consent was waived following the protocol of the Institutional Review Board due to the retrospective design of the study. Study design and objects This retrospective study focused on adult patients admitted to the NS-ICU at a tertiary hospital in South Korea. Since 2018, a full-time neuro-intensivist has been stationed in the 12-bed NS-ICU at SNUH. On average, approximately 30 neuro-critiTraumatic Optic Neuropathy | Kim NH, et al. 215 J Korean Neurosurg Soc 68 (2) : 213-222 cally ill patients are admitted to this unit each year. The study specifically targeted adult patients referred to the inpatient palliative care team after admission to the NS-ICU, with primary diagnoses of non-traumatic brain hemorrhage, traumatic brain injury, or brain neoplasm. Excluded from the study were patients who died before meeting the palliative care team or those with insufficient medical records. Inpatient palliative care consultation process Lacking a dedicated hospice ward or home hospice, SNUH exclusively offers inpatient palliative care consultation services. The inpatient palliative care consultation team consists of two physicians, one specializing in palliative care, and a clinical fellow in internal medicine or family medicine. Additionally, the team includes one palliative care nurse and one medical social worker (0.5 full time equivalent). This team engages with the patient and their family, conducting interviews, performing comprehensive assessments, exploring and discussing care objectives, and providing guidance to healthcare professionals. When interviewing is not feasible due to the patient’s condition in the NS-ICU, clinical evaluations are carried out, and family members are interviewed. The palliative care team particularly comes into play when a primary attending clinician (neuro-intensivist or neurosurgeon) initiates an on-demand palliative care referral based on the patient’s palliative care needs. Measurements We collected comprehensive patient data, including sociodemographics (age and sex), clinical details (severity, neurological condition, diagnosis, and comorbidities), consultation-related characteristics, and post-consultation healthcare resource utilization from medical records and palliative care interview notes. Severity at ICU admission was assessed using the 12-point Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, and the Glasgow coma scale (GCS) measured conditions at ICU entry, categorized as 8 or less, or 9 or more. Clinical diagnoses were classified as traumatic or non-traumatic, and by hemorrhage type (intracerebral, intraventricular, subarachnoid, or subdural). Comorbidities covered cancer, organ failure (chronic heart, pulmonary, liver, or renal), and neurodegenerative diseases. Prognostic evaluation scores determined in-hospital mortality and functional dependency, with specific measures for traumatic brain injury (FOUR score), subarachnoid hemorrhage (modified Fisher grading scale, Hunt & Hess score), and intracerebral/intraventricular hemorrhage (Functional outcome score and intracerebral hemorrhage score). The contents of palliative care consultations were extracted from interview notes, encompassing reasons for consultation, the number of interviews conducted, the number of participants interviews with the palliative care team, family’s understanding of patient conditions, patient’s and family’s preferences for LSTs, medical procedures requiring discussion, and disagreements on treatment decisions. To investigate the outcomes of palliative care consultations, we compared changes in code status before and after the consultation, length of hospital stays, mortality, and discharge location. The classification of code status included three categories : full code (indicating the implementation of all active measures), comfort care (focused on relief), and partial code (not requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation but needing essential medical treatment). An investigation was conducted on the medical treatment received by patients who died at SNUH within 48 hours of their death. Statistical analysis Descriptive data were utilized to summarize the demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients, as well as the outcomes of palliative care consultations. For categorical variables, Pearson’s chi-squared test or Fisher’s exact test was applied. The comparison of code status proportions before and after palliative care consultation was conducted using McNemar-Bowker’s test. Overall survival, defined as the time from the date of palliative care consultation to the date of death, was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier estimation. The log-rank test was employed to compare overall survival according to various variables. All statistical analyses were two-sided, with statistical significance set at p<0.05. The analyses were conducted using STATA version 16.0 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA). RESULTS Patient characteristics A total of 38 patients were enrolled between December 2019 and December 2021, and baseline characteristics are detailed in Table 1. The median age was 65 years (interquartile range [IQR], 45–73 years), with 57.9% being women. Of the 38 patients, 31.6% had traumatic etiology. The most prevalent clinical diagJ Korean Neurosurg Soc 68 | March 2025 216  nosis was subarachnoid hemorrhage, followed by intracerebral or intraventricular hemorrhage, subdural hemorrhage, and brain neoplasms. Approximately 40% of patients had significant comorbidities. The median time from admission to NSICU to palliative care consultation was 3.5 days (IQR, 1–8 days).

All interviews involved family members, and 7.9% of the patients themselves participated. The predominant reasons for seeking palliative care consultation were family psychosocial support (94.7%), followed by goal-of-care discussions (68.4%), decision-making support (47.4%), and communication facilitation (39.5%) (Fig. 1). Issues addressed during the interview with palliative care consultation team Throughout the consultation process, the most frequently discussed options requiring decision-making were whether to administer MV (23.7%) and perform a tracheostomy (21.1%), as outlined in Table 2. Other topics included considering external ventricular drainage or a ventriculoperitoneal shunt (13.2%), as well as deciding to operate for brain lesions (7.9%). Among family members, 73.7% demonstrated a good understanding of the patient’s clinical condition and prognosis. The preference for LST could only be estimated for 47.4% of all patients, with the majority leaning towards a preference for withholding or withdrawal. Specifically, 42.1% of families expressed a desire to withhold LST, 15.8% wished to maintain the status quo, 15.8% wanted to withdraw LST, and 18.4% were undecided. Overall, there was disagreement about treatment in 47.4% of cases, with 26.3% experiencing internal family disagreement and an additional 26.3% facing disagreement between the famFig. 1.

Outcomes after palliative care consultation Among the 38 patients referred to palliative care, the median length of stay in the NS-ICU was 12.5 days, with an IQR of 5 to 20 days. The overall median length of stay for these patients was 14 days, with an IQR of 6 to 32 days. During hospitalization, 26 patients died, and 11 were transferred to another hospital, except for one patient who was discharged home (Table 3). Over a median follow-up period of 179 days (ranging from 0 to 1260 days), mortality occurred in 84.2% of the patients (32 patients), with 27 in-hospital deaths. Out of the total, 70.4% of deaths (19 out of 27) occurred in the NS-ICU. The median overall survival was 13 days (95% confidence interval, 5 to 32 days) (Fig. 2). Before the palliative care consultation, full code status, partial code status, and comfort care alone were reported as 32%, 66%, and 2%, respectively; after consultation, these figures shifted to 11%, 42%, and 47%, respectively (Fig. 3). This change was statistically significant (p<0.001). Fig. 4 provides an assessment of the medical treatment and medication administered to 27 individuals who died at our institute within 48 hours of their death. All patients underwent MV, with 14 patients (51.9%) choosing to withdraw ventilator use. Imaging and blood tests were performed until the day before death for 77.8% and 74.1% of patients, respectively. Only 40% of patients received comfort care. Fig. 3.

Furthermore, the research reveals a noteworthy finding : a shift towards comfort-oriented code status following palliative care consultation. Importantly, our study illuminates the trajectory of palliative care for neurosurgical patients and their families, a group often overlooked but needing palliative care alongside intensive care as comprehensive approaches. Our study shows that the primary reason doctors referred patients to palliative care was for family psychosocial support, aligning with trends seen in similar ICUs abroad 34). Internationally, a neuro-ICU study revealed that 62% of patients and their families had palliative care needs, with 53% requiring social support 7). Particularly regarding anxiety and depression, several prospective studies revealed that the prevalence of moderate to severe mood symptoms was identified in 36.4% to 54.5% of family members of patients with severe acute brain injury 6,24,25). Some studies additionally reported that caregivers are at a greater risk for post-traumatic stress and burden 8,24). Our study suggests that doctors identified the needs of family caregivers during discussions of treatment plans as most patients were not able to communicate, resulting in a high prevalence of family support as the referral cause. In alignment with previous research on palliative care needs for critically ill patients 27), our study identifies goals of care conversations and decision-making support as major reasons for referral. Ensuring goal-concordant care for patients and their families is of utmost importance in patient-centered care, a principle that extends to patient care in the NS-ICU. However, as our research demonstrates, only around half of the cases allow for the estimation of patient values and preferences. Making decisions on behalf of NS-ICU patients’ families is, therefore, challenging in such situations 28). Ethical principles guiding surrogate decision-making say that the tendency to omit determining or estimating the patient’s previous wishes and to rely solely on the surrogate’s opinion should be avoided 21). In our study, tracheostomy, often chosen in approximately 30% of patients with severe acute brain injury 17), and MV were the main options that required discussion. According to a qualitative study reflecting on tracheostomy decisions in family members of patients with severe acute brain injury 22), meeting a fundamental need for supportive, consistent communication centered around compassion, clarity, and hope would help family members make surrogate decisions regardless of the eventual outcomes. The role of palliative care in the context of decisionmaking support is not necessarily to encourage a transition to comfort care but to support the surrogate decision-makers by facilitating discussions centered on the patient, thereby guiding the surrogate decision-making process and reconciling disagreements 11). Our study reveals an anticipated shift towards favoring comfort care both before and after palliative care consultation, consistent with findings from research where palliative care was administered in the ICU 3,13,26,33), showing higher rates of DoNot-Resuscitate orders and a preference for comfort care. This observed association may be due to the process in which palliative care helps clarify the patient’s understanding of their disease state, explores preferences for patient-centered decisionmaking, and prompts consideration of goals of care. This process often leads family members to develop a more realistic understanding of the disease and make more informed decisions about LSTs. The integration of early palliative care in ICUs is predicted to reduce the length of hospital stay and costs by minimizing non-beneficial aggressive interventions for patients on LST, based on international experiences 15,18,26,36,37). However, in Korea, changes in code status may not directly indicate the withholding or withdrawal of LST due to the 2018 LST Decisions Act. The Act allows LST only for patients in the dying process, posing challenges in determining the dying process for neurocritical patients not brain dead. Further research is needed to understand how changes in code status align with the LST Decision Act. In our study, 84.2% of patients referred to palliative care ultimately died, while the survivors necessitated long-term care. MV was administered to all patients and functioned as an LST, with the consideration of withdrawal 12). The decision to discontinue MV in these cases involves ethical considerations for healthcare professionals 11). Should the decision be made to stop MV, it is essential to provide support for the emotional needs of the family. Notably, our study reveals that 40% of patients referred to palliative care received comfort treatment. The adequacy of such treatment may be compromised when end-of-life symptoms in neuro-critical patients are underestimated, as they may not manifest distressing symptoms themselves. However, a significant level of distressing signs was reported to be J Korean Neurosurg Soc 68 | March 2025 220  observed at the end-of-life 38). It is suggested that palliative care can contribute to appropriate end-of-life care in such circumstances 33). The findings of our study offer insights to the ongoing discourse concerning the implementation of palliative care for patients in the NS-ICU In South Korea. From a clinical standpoint, further deliberation is imperative regarding the optimal criteria for administering palliative care. Existing literature suggests traumatic brain injury with a poor neurological prognosis, extensive intracranial hemorrhage/subarachnoid hemorrhage with no surgical interventions, hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, low presenting GCS (<8 for >1 week or Glasgow outcome score <3), or two or more multisystem organ failure as triggers for palliative care referral 23,26). However, recognizing potential variations attributable to distinct national and cultural contexts, it becomes essential to propose indicators tailored to national circumstances. Institutionally, the study underscores a noteworthy incongruity where existing policies do not align with the paradigm shift towards the early integration of palliative care within disease-centered treatment. Additionally, access to hospice services for patients in the NS-ICU in South Korea is restricted, except for cases involving malignant brain neoplasms. The implementation of palliative care may require the establishment of a pertinent system to address these unique challenges. This study’s limitations stem from its focus on a single tertiary care center with a small subject pool, limiting the generalizability of findings. Palliative care consultation was formally integrated into the Korean healthcare system following the implementation of the LST Decision Act in 2018, which limited our data collection to that year onward. Given that palliative care consultation in the NS-ICU is still in its early stages, conducting a multicenter study to increase case numbers was not feasible. The limited number of patients admitted to the NSICU in this setting also made it unavoidable for our study to be a small-scale descriptive study. However, within the context of limited palliative care for critically ill neurosurgical patients in South Korea, the study holds significance. Second, the absence of a control group hinders the ability to compare and assess the unique impact of palliative care. Unfortunately, as a control group, we would have needed to select patients who did not receive palliative care among those using the NS-ICU within a relatively short period, which predominantly serves patients undergoing scheduled surgeries requiring post-operative ICU care. These patients did not fit our inclusion criteria, making it impossible to find an appropriate control group. Future research should prioritize prospective comparative studies to clarify the effectiveness of such interventions. Additionally, the retrospective nature of the analysis prevents an exploration of subjective improvements in the quality of life or care perceived by patients or their families in response to palliative care. Since the primary goal of palliative care is to enhance the quality of life for patients and their families, assessing patient (or family)reported outcomes is indeed necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of palliative care. Although our study, being a retrospective analysis, had limitations in systematically evaluating such outcomes, it will be crucial for future prospective studies to include outcomes such as quality of life, decision-making conflicts, and mood to assess effectiveness. CONCLUSION In conclusion, for patients in an NS-ICU, palliative care was mostly consulted for psychosocial support and goals-of-care discussion. Despite the difficulties in estimating the patient’s treatment preference, palliative care consultation supported family members and facilitated treatment decision-making. According to our study, palliative care was well integrated into clinical practice in neuro-critical care, resulting in more comfort care at the end-of-life.

       " 'Introduction In the past, physicians did not routinely seek permission from patients before initiating diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, regardless of the risk . However, in recent years, emphasis has been shifted from physician sovereignty to patient autonomy, obliging physicians to expect and encourage patient participation in decision making after having given them all available relevant information, thus obtaining the patient’s informed consent to perform the given procedure . Neurologic patients in need of intensive care, however, may not be capable of participating in the informed-consent process, because of reduced consciousness or severe aphasia. Moreover, further clinical deterioration and complications may occur within the first hours after admission. Rapid identification and implementation of a suitable legal representative for participation in the consent process can be difficult and, in some instances, not feasible. Hence, in life-threatening situations, physicians perform procedures without consent, assuming that most individuals would assent to be treated in this situation. This approach has been widely discussed and agreed on . However, taking into account the possibility of an unfavorable outcome after neurointensive care, would * Correspondence: ines-christine.kiphuth@uk-erlangen.de Department of Neurology, University of Erlangen, Schwabachanlage 6, 91054 Erlangen, Germany Full list of author information is available at the end of the article Kiphuth et al.

Our objective was to assess patients’ retrospective willingness to undergo neurocritical care, given that functional outcome may be very poor. Furthermore, patients and relatives, regardless of the functional outcome, were asked whether they were satisfied with their treatment on our neurocritical care unit. Materials and methods Patients and Setting Between January 2006 and December 2007, 796 neurologic patients were admitted to our 10-bed neurocritical care unit (tertiary University Hospital). As we aimed to investigate the retrospective consent to specialized neurocritical care, we excluded 92 patients from this analysis because of (a) being temporarily monitored only after neuroradiologic procedures (n = 21), (b) representing outsourced patients from general ICUs (n = 42), or (c) being lost to follow up (n = 29). A total of 704 patients remained eligible for the final analysis. The institutional review board approved the study, and consent was obtained in written or oral form from all patients or their relatives/legal guardians. Data collection We obtained age, diagnoses, and medical history by reviewing the patients’ hospital charts and institutional electronic databases. Patients were grouped according to their neurologic diagnoses (1, ischemic stroke; 2, intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH); 3, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH); 4, meningoencephalitis; 5, epileptic seizures; 6, Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and myasthenia gravis (MG); 7, neurodegenerative diseases and encephalopathy; 8, cerebral neoplasm; and 9, intoxication). Patients or their relatives were contacted by using a mailed standardized questionnaire, which was answered by either the patient or the next of kin or the legal guardian (the legal guardianship was reassessed in regular intervals by the responsible courts). In all cases in which this questionnaire did not return within 6 weeks, a structured phone interview was conducted with the patients or their closest relatives. The telephone interviews were performed by a stroke physician who was trained and certified for data collection on disability, quality of life, and the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Consent to participate in this study was obtained in written or oral form from all patients or their relatives/ legal guardians. Because of functional impairment or death, a proportion of patients were not able to answer themselves (see Table 1). End-point definition Patients were asked to answer four questions: (a) functional status (expressed as mRS) before hospital admission, and (b) functional outcome (expressed as mRS) 12 months after hospital stay. Furthermore, patients were asked (c) if they retrospectively agreed with the treatment (that is, whether they would again consent to neurocritical care, given the experienced functional outcome 1 year after hospital stay). Consent was defined as the retrospective approval of the applied life-saving emergency procedures (for example, intubation, placement of ventricular drains) on admission to the neurocritical care unit (thereby explaining that withdrawal of consent would probably have correlated with rapid clinical worsening and the probability of early death). The possibility of answering the question of retrospective consent to neurocritical care was dichotomized. Finally, (d) patients were asked whether they were satisfied with their hospital stay. Satisfaction was defined as general contentment with the neuro-ICU (NICU) stay, wilfully neglecting the functional outcome (that is, contentment with how the patient and family members were covered by the staff, educated with regard to the prognosis and future course of the disease, and experienced decision making). The questionnaire provided five possible answers: very satisfied, satisfied, neither satisfied nor dissatisfied, dissatisfied, and very dissatisfied. The answers ‘very satisfied’ and ‘satisfied’ were categorized as satisfied, whereas ‘neither satisfied nor dissatisfied,’ ‘dissatisfied,’ and ‘very dissatisfied’ were scored as dissatisfied. Functional outcome was defined as favorable (mRS 0 to 1), mild to moderate disability (mRS 2 to 3), severe disability (mRS 4 to 5), and dead (mRS 6) , and also as independent (mRS 0 to 2) versus dependent or dead (mRS 3 to 6). Statistical analysis Statistical analyses were performed by using the SPSS 17.0 software package (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).

Continuous and categoric variables are expressed as median and range, or as percentage, as appropriate. Proportions between two groups were compared by using the c2 test, Fisher’s Exact test, or the Mann-Whitney U test, as appropriate. One stepwise forward-inclusion multivariate logistic regression model was calculated to determine parameters that independently predisposed for retrospective consent. Those parameters that showed at least a trend in univariate testing (P < 0.1) were included into the multivariate analysis. The parameter mRS was entered as a nominal variable. Interaction terms did not reveal significant interaction between the variables. Results The demographic and clinical characteristics of the analyzed 704 patients, as well as overall amount of consent and satisfaction, are given in Table 2. Of 241 patients with cerebral ischemia, 14 received decompressive surgery for malignant middle cerebral artery infarction, 11 of whom retrospectively consented to neurointensive care. Of 205 patients with ICH, hematoma evacuation was performed in 27 patients, nine of whom retrospectively consented. Overall satisfaction was high (>90%) and did not depend on age, functional status before admission, sex, or the necessity of mechanical ventilation. Analysis of satisfaction according to diagnoses, however, revealed that patients with epilepsy were less satisfied than the general cohort (P < 0.01). The declared satisfaction depending on the possible answers is shown in Figure 1. In contrast, retrospective consent was given in 51% of all patients only and was lowest in patients with stroke (P < 0.001; Table 2). The specific analysis of retrospective consent according to functional outcome is shown in Figure 2. Patients without disability (mRS 0 to 1), or who were only mildly to moderately disabled (mRS 2 to 3), consented to neurocritical care in 94%, and 76%, respectively, whereas patients with a mRS of 4 to 5 consented in only 19%. Relatives of patients who had died 1 year after disease onset gave retrospective consent in 38% (comparison between all groups: P < 0.001).

Critical Care 2010, 14:R144  Page 3 of 7 independently predicted consent is given in Table 4. Independent predictors for retrospective withdrawal of consent to neurocritical care were (a) worse functional outcome (expressed as an increase in the mRS), and (b) the diagnoses of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. Discussion In this study, we investigated the frequency of retrospective agreement to the applied neurocritical care in correlation to neurologic disease and functional outcome. As a key finding, consent was high in patients with good functional outcome, whereas survival with a poor functional condition was related to the lowest rates of consent, especially in stroke patients. First, it must noted that patients with acute onset of severe neurologic disease frequently are not capable of expressing their preferences regarding acceptance or decline of life-sustaining procedures . Moreover, in the acute situation, a potentially existing advance directive may not be at hand , and relatives, if present, may be too distraught to participate appropriately in the decision process . In addition, a dissociation of patients’ and relatives’ perception appears to exist in that regard, that survival itself does not necessarily imply survival with excellent outcome . This may be caused partly by shortcomings during the informed-consent process for planned procedures . Consent to neurointensive care measures the individual’s satisfaction with being alive. Other studies of nonneurologic patients have shown that an age-related correlation might exist between older age and an incline in life satisfaction in women; however, this has not been Figure 2 Consent and satisfaction depending on functional outcome 1 year after discharge. Although no differences in overall satisfaction were noted among the outcome groups, the c2 Test for retrospective consent revealed significant differences between the four groups (P < 0.001).

Kiphuth et al. Critical Care 2010, 14:R144  Page 4 of 7 revealed in men . In our study, no correlation was found between consent and age or sex. Furthermore, several studies showed a relation between chronic neurologic illnesses and less life satisfaction . As experienced, severe neurologic diseases, which led to neurointensive care, may have a long-term outcome similar to that of severe chronic diseases; this is in line with our results that more-severe long-term consequences lead to less retrospective consent. The literature on the correlation of retrospective agreement to specific invasive treatment and functional outcome is less conclusive. Although Foerch and colleagues  reported a correlation between the retrospective decision against treatment and rather unfavorable outcome, and Walz and co-workers  also concluded that consent might depend on outcome in patients undergoing hemicraniectomy, other authors did not find a relation between functional outcome and retrospective agreement to therapy . In another study, the willingness of patients to undergo intensive care to achieve even 1 additional month of survival was high; however, when asked if this would also apply if the patients were in a vegetative or severely neurologically impaired state, willingness to undergo intensive care was much less . This again shows that there may be a difference in accepting general intensive care compared with neurointensive care, as the latter is associated with a higher likelihood of cognitive impairment. Several novel issues presented here add to this discussion. Consent to neurocritical care declines with increasing disability. However, in patients who died in the course of the disease, increased rates of consent were presumed by the families. This reflects a previously unnoticed and highly important finding. These results indicate that death may not be judged to be the worst outcome by some patients or their relatives, and a proportion of patients may prefer death to severely disabled survival or a vegetative state . The data presented here have several shortcomings. Data were collected in a single center, and the sample size may have limited the statistical power. Furthermore, because of intercultural differences, the results may not be internationally valid. In addition, consent was assessed one year after neurocritical care; however, answers given in questionnaires or telephone interviews have an inherent dependence on how the questions are stated, thus possibly leading to discrepancies across similar studies. Furthermore, other possibly important parameters, such as depression, were not collected. Finally, the fact that exclusively relatives have answered the questionnaires in all cases in which patients had died, represents a systemic bias, as the provision of time, money, and manpower when caring for patients at home versus transferring them into a nursing home may affect the given answers. Conclusions Two aspects – (a) incapability to state preferences regarding life-sustaining therapies after symptom onset and missing advance directive, and (b) absent consent to neurocritical care if survival is poor – lead to a therapeutic dilemma in neurocritical care. Precisely because the majority of patients are not capable of stating their treatment preferences, a general initiation of neurocritical care assumes the patients’ agreements in the acute phase . This may result in prolonged disease duration and partly delays the decision to limit treatment until severe complications occur during the course of the disease .

Nonetheless, it will, in all likelihood, remain an ethical discussion whether to initiate neurocritical care in patients in whom palliative therapy may to be more appropriate.

       " 'INTRODUCTION Neurocritical care has been classified as a subspecialty of neurology that primarily focuses on critical care for neurologically ill patients and neurological care for critically ill patients.1 Previous studies have found that providing neurocritical care services may improve clinical outcomes in critically ill patients with neurological diseases, including traumatic brain injury, intracerebral hemorrhage, and subarachnoid hemorrhage.2-6 Social awareness about patient safety has also increased the awareness about high-quality neurocritical care among patients and neurologists. Having a neurointensivist staff member and organizing the intensive care unit (ICU) infrastructure are crucially important for providing adequate care to neurocritically ill patients.7,8 However, there is currently a lack of full-time neurointensivists in Korean hospitals despite the presence of neurological, neurosurgical, or general ICUs in most general hospitals.9 To our knowledge, the effects of full-time neurointensivist staffing in a dedicated neurological intensive care unit (NRICU)—which may comprise a different patient population than a neurosurgical ICU, a combined neurological and neuroMyung-Ah Ko a* Jung Hwa Lee a* Joong-Goo Kim a,b Suyeon Jeong a Dong-Wha Kang a Chae-Man Lim c Sang-Ahm Lee a Kwang-Kuk Kim a Sang-Beom Jeon a a\\x07Departments of Neurology and c\\x07Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea b\\x07Department of Neurology, Jeju National University Hospital, Jeju, Korea pISSN 1738-6586 / eISSN 2005-5013 / J Clin Neurol 2019;15(3):360-368 /  Received November 7, 2018 Revised February 25, 2019 Accepted February 25, 2019 Correspondence Sang-Beom Jeon, MD, PhD Department of Neurology, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, 88 Olympic-ro 43-gil, Songpa-gu, Seoul 05505, Korea Tel +82-2-3010-3440 Fax +82-2-474-4691 E-mail sbjeonmd@gmail.com *These authors contributed equally to this work. cc This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License ( which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. JCN Open Access ORIGINAL ARTICLE  361 Ko MA et al. JCN surgical ICU, or a general ICU—on the quality of care and outcomes of neurocritically ill patients have not been described previously. The ICU can be organized in two ways in terms of the role played by an intensivist, and this may influence the quality of critical care and patient outcomes.10 In an open-type ICU, patients are admitted to the ICU under the care of a nonintensivist physician, and an intensivist is available to provide their expertise via elective or mandatory consultations.11 In a closed-type ICU, patient care is transferred to an intensivist who is responsible for the clinical management and family meetings.12 For general critical care, the closed-type ICU is thought to be a more favorable setting than the open type in terms of patient safety and efficiency in the use of ICU resources.11,13,14 However, studies of the effects of the two ICU types on quality of care and patient outcomes in the field of neurocritical care are lacking. Here we report the effects of full-time neurointensivist staffing in a closed-type NRICU on the quality of critical care and patient outcomes. METHODS Study design and population A quasi-experimental uncontrolled before-and-after study design was utilized. Patients were included in the current study if they were admitted to the NRICU of the Department of Neurology at Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea between March 1, 2010 and February 28, 2016. Patients were excluded if they were younger than 18 years, did not have medical records available for analysis in this study, or if brain death was declared before admission to the NRICU. Two time periods were defined according to the appointment of a neurointensivist: the before period (from March 1, 2010 to February 28, 2013) and the after period (from March 1, 2013 to February 28, 2016). This study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards, and the need for written informed consent was waived because of the retrospective design of the study (IRB No. 2016-0379). Infrastructure and staffing of the NRICU The NRICU of Asan Medical Center includes 13 beds, 7.5 of which are formally assigned to patients admitted to the Department of Neurology. When critically ill patients are admitted to the Department of Neurology, they are admitted routinely to the NRICU. During the before period, these patients were managed by neurology residents, neurology fellows, and attending neurologists, and elective consultations with general intensivists were performed as necessary (open-type ICU). A full-time neurointensivist (S.-B.J.) was appointed on March 1, 2013, after which neurology patients in the NRICU were managed by neurology residents and this neurointensivist. Patient care in the NRICU was transferred to the neurointensivist (closed-type ICU). For 92 patients with seizures or status epilepticus, the neurointensivist provided mandatory comanagement with attending neurologists; such management was transferred completely to the neurointensivist after January 2016. The neurointensivist was also responsible for every consultation to the Department of Neurology for patients with a neurological problem during admission to general ICUs. In addition, the neurointensivist covered one session per week of the outpatient neurology clinic, where he followed up patients discharged from the NRICU and patients previously consulted at general ICUs. There were no other changes to the nurse staffing and infrastructure of the NRICU during the 6-year period of the current study. The characteristics of the NRICU infrastructure are compared between the two time periods in Table 1. The neurointensivist introduced protocols for use in the NRICU, including barbiturate coma therapy, targeted temperature management, measurement and management of intracranial pressure, osmotherapy, management of malignant infarctions, evaluation of brain death, evaluation and management of meningoencephalitis, and evaluation and management of comatose restoration of spontaneous circulation after cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The neurointensivist held regular sessions to educate neurology residents and NRICU nurses regarding these protocols and general issues related to neurocritical care. Data collection Electronic medical record and medical cost data were queried by the Information Technology Service Management of Asan Medical Center for all patients admitted to the NRICU during the study period. Data were obtained on demographics, comorbidities, vital signs, laboratory tests, medications, procedure records, complications, and clinical status (severity of illness) on admission, including scores on the Glasgow Coma Scale and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II). Additional patient information and formal reports on imaging investigations were retrieved from the electronic medical records and the picture archiving and communication system, respectively. Information on the survival status up to 6 months after admission to the NRICU was obtained from the electronic medical records. Hospital-acquired pneumonia and catheter-associated urinary tract infection were defined in accordance with international guidelines.13,15 Venous thromboembolism was diagnosed when computed tomography and/ or ultrasonography revealed a thrombus in the venous struc362 J Clin Neurol 2019;15(3):360-368 Appointing a Full-Time Neurointensivist JCN tures. Gastrointestinal bleeding was diagnosed in an endoscopy examination. The predicted in-hospital mortality rate was calculated based on the APACHE II score.16 Neurology consultations, inter-ICU transfers, family satisfaction, and medical costs The number of neurology consultations was assessed from general ICUs and the number of intrahospital inter-ICU transfers. Transfers were categorized into transfers from general ICUs (nonneurology departments) to the NRICU (neurology department) and transfers from the NRICU to general ICUs. The current study regarded the numbers of neurology consultations and inter-ICU transfers from general ICUs to the NRICU as proxies for the satisfaction of general intensivists (nonneurologists) with the neurological service provided by neurologists during the before period or by a neurointensivist during the after period. A hospital customer-satisfaction team conducted a patientfamily satisfaction survey regularly (twice yearly) throughout the 6-year study period. This survey consisted of a face-toface interview with 30 families of patients admitted to the NRICU who were chosen randomly by the team. The questionnaire comprised one item assessing the general satisfaction with medical services in the NRICU and four items assessing opinions about physicians (neurologists or a neurointensivist), including their kindness, trust, explanations, and availability for family meetings. Each item of the questionnaire was rated on a 5-point scale, with the lowest score representing dissatisfaction and the highest score representing satisfaction. Total medical costs incurred during the hospital stays were calculated for the two study periods. They were organized into cost per year and cost per patient, with the latter further categorized into deductible and nondeductible costs. Statistical analysis Data are presented as median and interquartile range (IQR) values for continuous variables and as number and percentage values for categorical variables. Baseline characteristics (demographics, comorbidities, diagnosis, and severity of illness), clinical management, quality indicators, clinical outcomes, the number of neurology consultations, the number of inter-ICU transfers, and the family satisfaction scores were compared between before and after appointing a full-time neurointensivist. Pearson’s χ2 test and Fisher’s exact test were used for categorical variables, and the t test or the Mann-Whitney U test was used for continuous variables, as appropriate. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to generate survival curves, and the curves were compared using a Cox proportional hazards analysis with adjustments for demographics, comorbidities, and severity of illness (total acute physiology scores on the APACHE II score). Statistical significance was defined as a two-tailed p value of <0.05. All data were analyzed using SPSS (version 21, IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA). Table 1.

JCN RESULTS There were 15,210 admissions to the Department of Neurology during the study period: 7,550 during the before period and 7,660 during the after period. Of these, 1,057 and 1,229 patients were admitted to the NRICU during the before and after periods, respectively. Sixty-two patients who were admitted to the NRICU during the before period were excluded for the following reasons: younger than 18 years (9 patients), medical records unavailable due to transfer to the Department of Psychiatry (3 patients), and hospital readmission to the NRICU (50 patients). Likewise, 25 patients who were admitted to the NRICU during the after period were excluded for the following reasons: younger than 18 years (3 patients), medical records unavailable (2 patients), hospital readmission to the NRICU (18 patients), and brain death declared prior to admission to the NRICU (2 patients). The remaining 2,199 patients were included in the final analysis, comprising 995 (13.2%) during the before period and 1,204 (15.7%) during the after period. Accordingly, the number of patients who were admitted to the NRICU increased by 21% after appointing a neurointensivist (p<0.001). The 2,199 patients included 1,354 (61.6%) men. The patients were aged 63.4±14.6 years (mean±SD; median, 66.0 years; IQR, 55.0– 74.0 years), and their APACHE II score was 11.1±6.3 (median, 10.0; IQR, 7.0–15.0; Table 2). Clinical practices, quality indicators, and outcomes The clinical practices and complications during admission to the NRICU are listed in Table 3. Prophylaxis for deepvein thrombosis with subcutaneous unfractionated or lowmolecular-weight heparin was performed more frequently during the after period than during the before period (p< 0.010). There were nonsignificantly fewer patients with kidney injury requiring continuous renal replacement therapy during the after period than during the before period (p= 0.070). The specialized neurocritical care treatments of continuous electroencephalographic monitoring (p<0.001), intracranial pressure monitoring (p=0.078), therapeutic hypothermia (p<0.001), and barbiturate coma therapy (p=0.013) were performed more frequently during the after period than during the before period. The complication rates in the NRICU did not differ significantly between the two periods. Patient outcomes and quality indicators regarding clinical management are presented in Table 4. Among the patients on mechanical ventilation, there were nonsignificantly more mechanical ventilatior-free days during the after period than during the before period [median, 12 days (IQR, 4–20 days) vs. median, 10 days (IQR, 2–7 days), p=0.085]. The ICU stay was significantly shorter during the after period than during the before period [median, 3 days (IQR, 2–6 days) vs. median, 4 days (IQR, 2–8 days), p<0.001], as was the hospital stay [median, 12.5 days (IQR, 7–31 days) vs. median, 14 days (IQR, 8–36 days), p<0.001] .

The 6-month mortality rate did not differ significantly between the after and before periods [n=149 (12.4%) vs. n=146 (14.7%), p=0.131]. Applying a Cox proportional hazards model revealed that appointing a neurointensivist did not result in statistically significant differences in 6-month mortality after adjustments for demographics (age and sex), comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, alcohol, and smoking), and acute physiology scores on the APACHE II score (hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% confidence interval, 0.652–1.031; p=0.089) (Fig. 1). Neurology consultations, inter-ICU transfers, and family satisfaction The number of neurology consultations increased after appointing a full-time neurointensivist, from 2,070 (9.7%) to 3,097 (14.7%) (p<0.001). Inter-ICU transfers from general ICUs to the NRICU [21 (2.1%) vs. 40 (3.3%), p=0.111] increased nonsignificantly, and inter-ICU transfers from the NRICU to general ICUs [29 (2.9%) vs. 8 (0.7%), p<0.001] decreased significantly (Table 5). The mean scores for the general satisfaction of patient families with medical services during admission to the NRICU increased from 78.3 to 89.7; that is, the degree of general satisfaction increased by 14.6%. The mean scores for questions about physicians in terms of their kindness (from 81.3 to 91.7), decision-making (from 81.0 to 91.3), explanations (from 79.7 to 91.0), and availability for family meetings (from 72.3 to 85.0) also all increased. Medical costs The total medical cost incurred during the hospital stays was 15,325,767,625 won for 995 patients during the before period and 16,880,071,965 won for 1,204 patients during Table 3.

The annual medical cost increased from 5,108,589,208 won during the before period to 5,626,690,655 won during the after period. Thus, the annual hospital income increased by 518,101,447 won after appointing a single neurointensivist. The total median medical cost per patient was 10,993,897 won during the before period and 9,914,534 won during the after period (p=0.001). The medical cost paid by patients decreased from 3,925,302 won to 3,288,087 won (p< 0.001), and that paid by the National Health Insurance Corporation decreased from 6,811,628 won to 6,214,627 won (p= 0.026) after appointing a neurointensivist. Thus, both the medical cost per patient paid by the patients themselves and that paid by the National Health Insurance Corporation decreased significantly after appointing a neurointensivist (Table 6). DISCUSSION We investigated the effect of appointing a full-time neurointensivist to manage a closed-type NRICU. After appointing a neurointensivist, the length of NRICU stays decreased by 1 day (from 4 to 3 days); this decrease was maintained in our analysis of the length of hospital stays (from 14.0 to 12.5 days). The decreases in the lengths of ICU and hospital stays did not occur at the expense of patient safety, including the ICU readmission rate. Rather, the decrease in length of stay allowed significantly more admissions to the NRICU (which increased by 21%), which demonstrates the more efficient utilization of NRICU beds. Furthermore, the in-hospital and 6-month mortality rates showed decreasing tendencies, from 5.6% to 4.6% and from 14.7% to 12.4%, respectively, but these changes were not statistically significant.

Inter-ICU transfers from the NRICU to general ICUs decreased, whereas those from general ICUs to the NRICU increased. The patient families also reported an increase in general satisfaction regarding the medical services provided by physicians (neurologists or a neurointensivist) during admission to the NRICU. Moreover, the medical cost for each patient incurred during the hospital admission and paid either by patients or the National Health Insurance Corporation decreased significantly. However, the total medical costs paid to the hospital increased due to the number of patients increasing. Thus, the current study suggests that appointing a full-time neurointensivist in a preexisting NRICU improves the quality of care and outcomes for neurocritically ill patients. The in-hospital mortality rate in the current study decreased by 1% after implementing a full-time neurointensivist; that is, 1 more of every 100 neurocritically ill patients survived after this change. However, this finding did not reach statistical significance, which is probably due to the sample size being insufficient and the already low mortality rate of the preexisting NRICU infrastructure of the study hospital. Alternatively, the lower mortality in the current study compared with previous studies may have been due to differences in the study populations: patients with traumatic brain injury, intracerebral hemorrhage, and subarachnoid hemorrhage who are admitted to a neurosurgical ICU or a combined neurological and neurosurgical ICU generally have a higher mortality rate than patients with ischemic stroke and other neurological diseases.17,18 The observed in-hospital mortality rate was below that expected based on APACHE II score during both the before period (5.6% vs. 9.8%) and the after period (4.6% vs. 9.7%), respectively. The decrease in the 6-month mortality rate may be related to the beneficial effects provided by having a neurointensivist in the NRICU because appropriate care during the critical phase of illness may improve the long-term outcomes of patients.19 Our findings suggest that appointing a neurointensivist and changing the organization of an NRICU from an open type to a closed type can reduce patient mortality. However, this interpretation requires confirmation since this was a single-center study and our findings did not reach statistical significance. Studies assessing the satisfaction of general intensivists and the families of patients in the NRICU are lacking. We considered the number of neurology consultations and inter-ICU transfers as proxies for the satisfaction of general intensivists who were working in nonneurology ICUs with the performance of neurologists or the neurointensivist. These proxies were used because no data from prospective surveys of coworkers were available, and a survey initiated during the after period could be affected by recall bias. The number of neurology consultations from general ICUs and inter-ICU transfers from general ICUs to the NRICU increased after appointing a neurointensivist. This could be interpreted as indicating that the satisfaction of general intensivists with the neurology service provided by the neurointensivist increased compared to the service provided by neurologists. Alternatively, the decrease in the number of inter-ICU transfers from the NRICU to general ICUs might be related to the competence of a closed-type NRICU run by a neurointensivist. To assess the satisfaction of the families of patients, the results of the prospective survey performed during the before period and the after period were available for the current study. These results showed that the general satisfaction of patient families with critical care in the NRICU and with how the physicians performed increased after appointing a neurointensivist. Thus, having a neurointensivist staff member might also satisfy the general intensivists by managing neurological problems occurring in general ICUs and satisfy the patient families by providing improved critical care in the NRICU. Our study was subject to some limitations. First, a singleTable 6.

JCN center retrospective study inherently has a risk of selection bias, and so the results of our study might not be broadly applicable to other centers. The NRICU of our hospital was separate from the neurosurgical ICU, and the current study was designed to evaluate patients admitted to the NRICU. Thus, most patients who presented with traumatic brain injury, intracerebral hemorrhage, and subarachnoid hemorrhage were not included in the current study. In addition, the infrastructure and environment of a hospital, and the training background, capability, and working environment of the neurointensivist may affect the study results. Second, the quality of critical care and clinical outcomes might have improved due to either appointing a neurointensivist or the availability of new advanced medical technology, given that the study period was 6 years. Improved family satisfaction could also be due to both the neurointensivist and hospital-wide efforts to provide better medical care for hospitalized patients. Likewise, we interpreted the numbers of neurology consultations and inter-ICU transfers from general ICUs to the NRICU as proxies for the satisfaction of our coworking general intensivists, but increases in these numbers might not directly represent increased satisfaction. Third, the clinical outcomes of the patients were defined using the survival rate rather than functional outcomes because the latter data were not available for the current retrospective study. The mortality rate may be an inadequate parameter for evaluating the clinical outcomes of neurocritically ill patients. Fourth, the satisfaction of neurology residents and nurses regarding the education they received about neurocritical care and management in the NRICU was not investigated, because none of the residents and only a small proportion of the nurses were employed in the NRICU throughout the 6-year study period. Fifth, the professional burnout of the neurointensivist was not assessed. Although the current study showed that appointing a neurointensivist was associated with improvements in quality indicators and patient outcomes, running a closed-type NRICU for a prolonged period with a single neurointensivist may eventually lead to negative impacts on patient care and safety due to neurointensivist burnout.20 In conclusion, appointing a full-time neurointensivist and implementing organizational changes for running a closedtype NRICU have beneficial effects on quality indicators of critical care, patient outcomes, and satisfaction of general intensivists and patient families. However, the present results should not be interpreted as evidence that appointing a single neurointensivist is sufficient to run a closed-type NRICU. Given the shortage of neurointensivists in Korea, hospital administrative efforts should also be made to prevent professional burnout and enable shift work for neurointensivists.

       " 'Introduction Admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) is often a sudden, devastating, and life-threatening event. Discharge from the ICU marks the end of this hyperacute phase, but is just the beginning of the recovery journey for many patients and their informal caregivers. Critical care advances have meant that more patients are surviving their critical care illness (CCI) . Until recently, the primary focus during hospitalization was on physiological parameters and markers of recovery (e.g., vital sign stability). However, CCI affects survivors’ and caregivers’ health in unanticipated ways . Survivors often suffer from new or worsened physical, cognitive, and emotional sequelae despite making good recovery of their CCI; informal caregivers can experience substantial emotional distress. These CCIrelated sequelae—termed post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) and PICS-family (PICS-F) by the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) —often become chronic and increase risk for morbidity and mortality [3–5]. Traditionally, PICS and PICS-F have been considered distinct from the sequelae observed in survivors of acute brain injuries (ABI; e.g., traumatic brain injury, TBI; stroke). In order to avoid the confounding effect of the neurological injury on the classical symptoms of PICS, the neurocritical care population has largely been excluded from “PICS”-related research, and neurocritical care physicians have largely been absent from the SCCM PICS stakeholder conferences regarding development and dissemination of information. The main goal of this paper is to familiarize healthcare providers with PICS and how it might relate to our patients and their informal caregivers. We begin by concisely reviewing the PICS and PICS-F literature in the non-neurosciences population to provide a general understanding of PICS as an acquired phenomenon in the absence of known neurological injury. Next, we review the additional impact of neurological injury on cognitive, physical, and emotional outcomes among neurocritical care patients and families, address challenges in studying PICS in this population, and discuss ways to advance the science of recovery among critically ill patients and their families. PICS and PICS-F in Critical Care Patients Without Acute Brain Injury Physical Effects of Critical Illness The most common CCI-related physical impairment is weakness. This includes critical illness polyneuropathy and/or myopathy, which occurs in at least a quarter of medical ICU (MICU)/surgical ICU survivors without preexisting neuromuscular disease , and has associated pathological changes . The acquired weakness is independently associated with multiorgan failure (e.g., severe sepsis), sedation, pharmacological (e.g., steroid) treatment, and prolonged mechanical ventilation (> 4–7 days) . Joint contractures can LaBuzetta et al. Page 2 Neurocrit Care. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2020 June 01. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript also occur as a result of limited mobility . These physical impairments increase inhospital morbidity and also mortality at one year . Cognitive Effects of Critical Illness Prolonged cognitive impairment is common among survivors of CCI and occurs with a frequency greater than expected when compared with normative data. The most commonly reported domains of cognitive impairment are attention, executive functioning/verbal fluency, visual and working memory, and visuospatial skills [9–12]. Several high-quality prospective studies are worth mentioning. The Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a national cohort of individuals > 50 years, showed that among 516 surviving respondents with incident sepsis from the HRS, only 6.1% had moderate-to-severe cognitive impairment prior to incident sepsis, with that number increasing to nearly 17% afterward . Similarly, among previously unimpaired MICU patients younger than 55 who require mechanical ventilation, 32% show cognitive impairment in 2 or more cognitive domains 6 months later , without any newly appreciated in-hospital neurological injury to explain these new impairments. In another large, single-center cohort of 821 patients, 40% of the patients had global cognition scores that were similar to scores of patients with moderate TBI (1.5 SD below the population mean), while approximately 25% of individuals had cognitive performance scores similar to patients with mild Alzheimer’s disease (2 SD below the population mean) at 3 months post-discharge. At 12 months, these numbers were 34% and 24%  indicating some improvement, though a clinically significant number of individuals still do not reach near-normative values . Moreover, these ICU admissions do not need to be long-lasting for onset of short-term and long-term cognitive difficulty; in the Sukantarat et al.  study, patients needed to be admitted to the ICU for only 72 hours to be included. Despite a lack of any known neurological injury in these critically ill patients, there does seem to be an anatomic correlation for these new cognitive deficits. Computed tomography head imaging reveals significant atrophy in acute respiratory distress syndrome survivors compared with age- and sex-matched controls . Using magnetic resonance imaging, VISIONS researchers noted brain atrophy in the frontal lobes and hippocampi of CCI survivors, as well as decreased fractional anisotropy scores (a marker of white matter integrity) in the corpus callosum and anterior limb of the internal capsule using diffusion tensor imaging at 3-month follow-up . These volume and white matter changes correlated with delirium duration, and the white matter changes further correlated with cognitive impairment at 12 months. Psychiatric Effects of Critical Illness in Patients and Caregivers Symptoms of depression, post-traumatic stress (PTSD), and anxiety are common after CCI and often become chronic, negatively impacting physical recovery and increasing risk for morbidity and mortality. Lasting neuropsychiatric effects may also occur in patients’ informal caregivers, up to years following a loved one’s illness [17–19], and appear related to the patient’s post-ICU disability  but independent of whether the patient survived . These effects then impact caregivers’ own health-related quality of life . LaBuzetta et al. Page 3 Neurocrit Care. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2020 June 01. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Post-Traumatic Stress—PTSD is a response to a life-threatening event that continues for at least four weeks post-trauma and includes avoidance of trauma reminders, physiological hyperarousal, re-experiencing, and negative cognitions . Since admission to the ICU is often sudden and life-threatening, many patients develop post-traumatic stress (PTS) symptoms that can transition to PTSD. Caregivers who witness life-threatening CCI can also develop PTSD [24–26]. Symptoms of PTS are seen following medical, cardiovascular, surgical, trauma, and burn CCI , encompassing a host of diagnoses (e.g., respiratory failure, sepsis, cardiac arrest). The prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder in CCI survivors is high and persists over time . More than 75% of mixed ICU patients referred for neuropsychological evaluation report at least one stressful in-ICU experience (e.g., nightmares, severe pain, breathing difficulty, or a feeling of suffocation) . A recent meta-analysis in 36 unique cohorts of patients surviving critical illness found a pooled prevalence of PTSD of 25–44% at 6 months depending on the severity cutoff used for the Impact of Event Scale . At one-year follow-up, PTSD symptoms are still reported in upwards of 20% of survivors . Rates of PTSD in caregivers of CCI survivors range between 11.1 and 57.1% depending on the instrument used and timepoint of assessment . These high prevalence rates are corroborated by studies using the PTSD Checklist for DSM-V (PCL-V), which has a high concordance with diagnostic interviews . Depression—There are similar clinical risk factors for depression as for other psychiatric disorders, for example, hypoglycemia , sepsis , and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) . Some researchers have noted a long-lasting comorbidity between CCI-associated depression and PTSD . In a large, multicenter study investigating neuropsychological health after critical illness, the reported prevalence of depression was high at 37% (N = 406) . In patients with no preexisting history of depression, depressive symptoms still occur in nearly 30% at 12 months and are even higher in patients with preexisting depression. At five years, prevalence is still nearly 20% in a multicenter cohort study of ARDS survivors . Smaller cohorts have a wider range of rates of depression, though they are still significantly higher than the general population prevalence of < 10% . Similarly, rates of depression in caregivers range between 4.7 and 36% . Anxiety—Anxiety has been less studied. Published rates of anxiety most often use the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (anxiety subscale) questionnaire, and, in general, range from 16 to 24% in long-term survivors of CCI, though rates as high as 62% have been reported . These prevalence rates of anxiety are higher than the general population , and there are no differences in prevalence between medical, surgical, and trauma ICU patients even a year after discharge . Caregivers experience anxiety with rates similar to patients (15–25%) . Risk Factors as Defined in Non-Neurocritical Population Several risk factors interact with CCI to contribute to the development of PICS and PICS-F with subsequent decreased health-related quality of life (see Fig. 1). LaBuzetta et al. Page 4 Neurocrit Care. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2020 June 01. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Non-Modifiable Factors—Younger patients may be at higher risk for PTSD . Female gender is regularly reported as a risk factor for depression in both patients and family members following CCI . One of the most robust predictors of PICS- or PICS-F-related psychiatric illness is lifetime history of mental illness [18, 20, 34–36, 42], with a relative risk of 3.9 (95% CI 1.5–6.5) . Prior cognitive impairment is also a risk factor for post-ICU worsened cognitive function . Modifiable Factors: Sedation, Delirium and Agitation, and Length of Stay—The pathophysiological relationship between sedation, delirium, and cognitive impairment is multifactorial and outside the scope of this paper, but sedation and delirium may impact future development of PICS. With delirium, patients can experience psychotic symptoms, and delusional memories of an ICU admission predict PTSD, so delirium may be a risk factor . Additionally, in hundreds of patients enrolled in the BRAIN-ICU study, a longer duration of delirium was independently associated with both worsened global cognitive and executive function . A British pathology-based study reported that the odds ratio for developing dementia at > 85 years old was 8.7 in patients with delirium , and in patients without prior cognitive impairment, this incident dementia was not mediated by traditional neuropathological changes. If delusional, fragmented memories contribute to PTSD, then processing those memories may decrease the vulnerability to developing PTSD. ICU diaries used to address memory gaps have shown benefits (mostly in single-center trials) in PICS and PICS-F in Europe, Canada, and the USA [45–49] with a large prospective multicenter trial ongoing in France . Data on the relationship between sedation and PICS are mixed. Several studies have reported a relationship between benzodiazepine sedation and PICS . One study reported increased relative risk of depression in patients with a mean daily ICU benzodiazepine dose > 100 mg of midazolam-equivalent agent , and another noted increased PTSD with larger total dose of lorazepam . This correlation was not seen in the larger BRAIN-ICU cohort , which was completed more recently and may reflect a growing interest in sedation reduction . It may be that the higher doses of sedation— and in particular benzodiazepines and opiates, rather than propofol and dexmedetomidine —or lack of sedation holidays are more detrimental to downstream cognitive impairment and mental illness, especially PTSD . Kress and colleagues suggested daily sedation holidays until a patient is reliably following commands or uncomfortable/agitated . Conversely, agitation or placement of restraints (especially without sedation) is a risk factor for PICS . This agitation may be a marker or prodrome of PTS, and benzodiazepines might reflect the management of this anxiety/ agitation . Length of stay (LOS) is another risk factor for PICS and a significant predictor of PTSD . Mechanical ventilation , a longer time to develop delirium, and immobility  are likely a few mediators of this risk rather than severity of illness . LaBuzetta et al. Page 5 Neurocrit Care. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2020 June 01. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript PICS and PICS-F in Patients with Acute Brain Injury Within the neurointensive care unit (NeuroICU), research on PICS is emerging. It is well known that certain neurological diagnoses are associated with neurocognitive changes, for instance stroke . However, many disorders are heterogenous, with only a fraction of patients experiencing associated CCI; admission to the NeuroICU is more complicated than having a specific diagnosis. To the extent that neurological diagnoses do not universally require intensive care, these studies are not pertaining to PICS (or PICS-like) effects. This approach is not errant; however, it negates the effect that CCI can have on the trajectory of disease and recovery. PICS is related to the experience of critical illness. With that limitation in mind, some diagnoses often include a portion of their hospital stay in the ICU: status epilepticus (SE), malignant cerebral edema following ischemic stroke, aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH), non-traumatic intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), and moderate-to-severe TBI. We will focus on these ABI diagnoses here. Status Epilepticus SE can be either convulsive or non-convulsive (NCSE); it is considered a risk factor for future cognitive impairment . In a retrospective study of outcomes following NCSE, approximately 15% of patients evidenced new cognitive impairment; however, it is unclear if some of these neurocognitive changes were related to the NCSE itself, the underlying trigger for NCSE, or medication effects . The same research group found that SE patients performed poorer than controls on memory, learning, and executive functioning tasks; the SE patients also performed significantly worse on tests of motor latency than did patients with > 10 lifetime seizures (but never SE) . Ischemic Stroke Admission to the ICU following stroke depends on severity and treatment history. However, malignant edema from ischemic stroke is often treated in the ICU. In a case series evaluating long-term outcomes following decompressive hemicraniectomy in these patients, we see that 100% evidenced impairments in multiple cognitive domains and 40% endorsed clinically significant depressive symptoms . When asked directly, 80% of patients considered surgery as a favorable course of action despite these deficits; 20% had aphasia too severe to answer for themselves. Similar multi-domain cognitive dysfunction has been reported in less detail elsewhere in a retrospective study with a larger cohort . Non-Traumatic ICH In the multicenter, double-blind FAST trial, researchers noted a high prevalence of depression (20%) that independently and negatively impacted quality of life (QoL) . Clinical severity and disability appear to impact development of depression . Taking all non-traumatic ICH together, one study found a prevalence of depression and anxiety of 23% and 8%, respectively, in 48 patients who presented for formal neuropsychological assessment; cognitive impairment (memory > psychomotor > executive functioning > language > visuospatial) was noted in 77%, and 13% met criteria for dementia . This effect may be further exacerbated by delirium and agitation, as seen in a prospective study LaBuzetta et al. Page 6 Neurocrit Care. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2020 June 01. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript measuring Neuro-QoL scores up to 1 year after surviving ICH . Within the prospective PITCH cohort, 37% without preexisting dementia showed cognitive decline following their ICH, which was associated with severity of cortical atrophy . A separate single-center study investigated early versus late incident dementia in ICH and found that different risk factors were influential at different times during recovery . Aneurysmal SAH In a single-center study of 111 patients, 95% reported at least one subjective cognitive or emotional complaint that affected everyday life . The most commonly cited objective cognitive impairments in aSAH are related to attention, memory, and executive functioning despite reports of “good outcomes” on traditional measures (e.g., Modified Rankin) [69–71]; in the large, multicenter prospective ISAT trial cohort, 32% of patients with a “good outcome” had cognitive impairment (performance at < 5%ile in ≥ 2 cognitive domains)  —rates of neuropsychological impairment similar to prior studies . We also see a high prevalence of depression (23– 44%) in aSAH patients [69, 75–78]. In combination with cognitive impairment, these emotional complaints contribute to decreased health-related QoL and inability to return to work . In studies that have prospectively investigated it, reported rates of anxiety and PTSD after aSAH are > 30% and > 35%, respectively . Additionally, even in perimesencephalic SAH—which is thought to have a good prognosis—approximately one-quarter of patients (N = 39) could not return to work in a prospective study over 8 years ; this was attributed to new neuropsychological changes and fatigue . Traumatic Brain Injury Focusing on civilian studies of moderate/severe TBI, cognitive dysfunction has an inconsistent pattern of cognitive impairment . Moreover, these neuropsychological changes evolve over time with different risk factors at different times . In querying the Traumatic Brain Injury Model Systems dataset, researchers reported an age-related impact on decline after TBI, with patients > 26 years having an increased likelihood of decline than younger patients (16–26) . At in-person 4-year follow-up of over 100 patients from the Paris-TBI cohort with severe TBI, cognitive complaints were noted in up to 68%; 43% had anxiety and 25% were noted to have depression despite nearly 80% of the cohort being independent in ADLs  and more than 33% being gainfully employed . A separate single-center cohort of 108 moderate-to-severe patients without intracranial hemorrhage found high rates of new cognitive impairment (52%), clinically significant depression (40%), and PTSD (26%), without a relationship seen between severity of injury and cognitive outcomes . These data should indicate that our neurocritical patients may survive their CCI yet continue to have unmet needs. It appears that PICS (or a PICS-like phenomenon) exists, but the neurological literature uses a different language to describe it. Moreover, there is a distinction between the disease-related neurocognitive changes and the neurocognitive changes associated with the hospitalization. As illustrated in the non-neurological critical care population, the neuropsychiatric effects of critical illness appear to represent a separate LaBuzetta et al. Page 7 Neurocrit Care.

In neurocritical care, perhaps this experiential injury is over and above that of the primary neurological injury. Challenges of Addressing PICS in Neurocritical Care Patients There is a fundamental difficulty in addressing PICS in the NeuroICU population, though our patient population may be at a high risk of developing PICS-like symptoms. Primary Brain Injury NeuroICU patients are admitted with ABI, sometimes in addition to other diagnoses known to be implicated in PICS (e.g., sepsis). Unfortunately, this new neurological injury makes it profoundly difficult to study PICS in this population since differentiating new neuropsychological changes related to primary neurological injury from symptoms related to critical illness is near impossible. Although studies using functional MRI can identify general locations involved in cognitive functioning, it is artificial to try to conclude that a new neuropsychological deficit can be attributed to a particular lesion rather than critical illness. It is more straightforward to attribute new neuropsychological findings to known brain injury, and this may leave PICS unattended in the NeuroICU population. In addition, many neurological injuries leave patients with new neurological symptoms (e.g., aphasia, impaired decision-making, and decreased arousal) that may make it difficult to study patients’ mental health using common methods (e.g., surveys). As providers, we need to tailor our assessment and treatments for individual ability to participate. Although ABI makes it harder to understand PICS in our patient population, it also makes it more important to identify ways of studying our patient population’s risk. Some neuropsychological changes are related to ABI, but it is possible that there is additional impairment related to the experience of CCI itself. The interrelationship among biological and psychological factors challenges our understanding of new neuropsychological impairment because there may be a component of post-NeuroICU impairment that is preventable based on an understanding of PICS pathophysiology and risk factors. Prolonged Sedation Sedation holidays and daily awakenings show benefit in mitigating neuropsychological impairment , but patients in the NeuroICU often have pathologies that preclude weaning of sedation. For instance, management escalation often necessitates anesthetic infusions and cerebral suppression using propofol, benzodiazepines, or barbiturates in the treatment of status epilepticus, uncontrolled intracranial pressure, and severe drug or alcohol withdrawal [87–90]. Thus, relative to the medical ICU, the NeuroICU disproportionately has patients who are not candidates for daily sedation interruption, which may increase the risk for neuropsychiatric sequelae. Lack of Noninvasive Monitoring Although some diagnoses require prolonged cerebral suppression, in many cases attempts are made to minimize sedation to optimize the neurological exam. This may affect our PICS patients’ risk, however. LaBuzetta et al. Page 8 Neurocrit Care. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2020 June 01. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript First, the Pain, Agitation, Delirium, Immobility and Sleep guidelines  are not adapted to a NeuroICU population. They recommend adjunctive non-opioid medications to reduce sedation and opioid needs, for example ketamine, which can increase intracranial pressure, thus being potentially detrimental in the NeuroICU. Neuropathic pain medications are also recommended, but their sedative and cognitive effects prevent their use in many neurological patients . Secondly, the neurological examination is the gold standard for noninvasive neuromonitoring. Unlike the cardiac (i.e., telemetry) or pulmonary (i.e., O2 saturation) systems, the neurological system lacks a highly sensitive way to continuously and noninvasively monitor neuroclinical status. While continuous electroencephalography (EEG) is utilized in the NeuroICU, and quantitative EEG can offer information regarding changes in cerebral activity, these are not universally used nor relied upon to determine clinically significant changes. Thus, patients are examined every one to four hours. The sleep disturbances that occur are an unfortunate corollary to frequently waking patients up for an interactive examination, often times for days in a row. Although nebulous, the link between sleep and delirium is theorized to include common pathophysiologic pathways, shared mechanisms, shared neurotransmitters, or a potential cause–effect relationship . This is relevant because if our frequent neurological examinations are contributing to a heightened risk for delirium, then we may also be contributing to an increased risk of neuropsychological sequelae in our patient population. Frightening Memories Frightening and delusional memories are symptoms of acute distress, and several studies have also identified them as risk factors for post-CCI psychiatric symptoms including PTSD . Some of the non-pharmacological mechanisms for preventing PTSD include rest, minimal stimulation, and explanations of any procedure being performed no matter how minimal (e.g., suctioning, serial examinations). However, many neurological patients have language impairment and struggle with comprehension. As such, routine care might be frightening, especially in someone who is unable to communicate or otherwise encephalopathic. Mobility Early mobility is known to improve physical outcomes after critical illness [94–96] and may also have some positive effects on delirium . Mobility challenges are complex in the NeuroICU, though many of these complexities—such as appropriate staffing, availability of physical and occupational therapists, mechanical ventilation, prevalence of tubes and lines— are shared with other ICU populations . Many patients in the NeuroICU also have external ventricular drains, lumbar drains, or other intracranial monitoring, which, though not a contraindication to mobility, add a degree of complexity. In addition, many patients with ABI also have motor impairment related to their primary injury, which may confound early mobility and rehabilitation efforts. LaBuzetta et al. Page 9 Neurocrit Care. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2020 June 01. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Effects on Neurocritical Care Families To fully discuss PICS in the neurocritical population, we must also address the effects of neurocritical illness on families and caregivers. There is evidence to support a PICS-F phenomenon [99–101], although the literature refers to it using different terminology. In a prospective study investigating caregivers of patients with advanced neurological illness, Trevick and Lord  found that signs of a traumatic response could be seen in 33% of caregivers at one month, with 17% of family members (N = 23) meeting criteria for PTSD at 6 months; these results were not explained by whether a patient died. The prevalence of depression and anxiety in family members has been reported as high as 8.6% and 20.7%, respectively, with no difference based on LOS . Vranceanu et al.  conducted a series of cross-sectional and prospective studies showing that ineffective coping, mindfulness , self-efficacy and social support , and the interpersonal patient– caregiver relationship  are important modifiable  factors associated with depression, anxiety, and PTS in patients and caregivers, and that early emotional distress tends to remain chronic over time . Perhaps, as a result of increased recognition of family and caregiver effects from neurocritical illness, there has been an increased focus on family-centered care in the NeuroICU. Hwang et al.  found increased satisfaction in families who participate in family meetings and also identified areas for improvement in family satisfaction including support during decision-making and control over the care of their loved ones. Shared decision-making also seems to be important; however, shared decision-making is difficult due to discordance between the kind of information decision-makers desire and that which is provided to them by physicians , as well as the limitations of decision aids available for use in the NeuroICU . No single intervention seems to be universally successful in preventing PICS-F , and a recent article noted that recovery interventions aimed at the patient alone are unsuccessful . To recognize the importance of patient–family and patient–caregiver dyads is to recognize the impact that psychosocial factors can make on recovery and neuropsychological outcomes for both the patient and their loved ones. Discussion Millions of critical illness survivors are discharged every year, yet neither they nor their informal caregivers are prepared for the new challenges that await them , including lengthy rehabilitation and new or worsened cognitive, psychiatric, and physical problems. These neuropsychological changes represent a CCI process that can be seen in the absence of objective neurological injury, which is why understanding neurocognitive changes in the non-neurological population is critical. To the extent that the neurosciences population also experiences CCI, our patients’ outcomes may improve with increased prevention and treatment of this CCI-related injury. If one accepts that there are potential neuropsychological effects of CCI, it raises the question: what are the next steps? Firstly, in order to move this field of inquiry forward, we must reframe our expectations for neurocritical care patients’ outcomes and better clarify the ways in which PICS is relevant in the NeuroICU (even though it may be difficult to parse out). Ultimately, a more complete understanding of these neuropsychological outcomes will be required for an effective LaBuzetta et al. Page 10 Neurocrit Care. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2020 June 01. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript assessment/treatment framework. To this end, the Neurocritical Care Society and Deutsche Gesellschaft für NeuroIntensivund Notfallmedizin held a joint session at Arbeitstagung NeuroIntensivMedizin on the topic of “Post ICU Syndrome—what happens in the NICU … stays with the patient”  with a position paper published . Although critical care physicians are increasingly aware of PICS and PICS-F, there are many opportunities for advancing our understanding within neurocritical care (and with those providers who follow our patients long-term). Limited awareness may lead to reduced quality of life . Another natural arena for collaboration with our non-neurosciences colleagues is to better elucidate the mechanisms that underlie the constellation of neuropsychological symptoms afflicting CCI survivors. One hypothesis is that patients with non-neurological critical illness are actually experiencing new neurological injury related to systemic organ dysfunction, and this new injury is simply below the threshold of identification using current technology (for instance, there is emerging literature on the pathophysiology of cerebral dysfunction in sepsis  that could be built upon). Thus, investigation into the mechanism of PICS in non-NeuroICU patients is an area where neurological expertise and collaboration may be beneficial, and it may help us to understand neuropsychological outcomes in our own neurocritical patients. In this way, neurocritical care is an extension of critical care rather than a separate entity. Additionally, we need to have a better understanding of the prevalence of PICS-like outcomes in NeuroICU patients. One goal is to identify modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors in order to detect patients at risk of neuropsychological sequelae, with interventions designed to mitigate those risks. In some circumstances, this may require reassessing clinical trial results or landmark recommendations (e.g., pain, agitation, and delirium guidelines , ABCDE bundles ) with attention paid to the NeuroICU population. For example, a trial is currently underway to evaluate the effects of non-sedation (versus sedation with a daily wake-up trial) on cognitive and physical outcomes . Although some neurocritical patients (e.g., those with status epilepticus or head trauma requiring therapeutic coma) will be excluded, neurological patients will not broadly be excluded. Moreover, when conducting trials, we propose keeping these neuropsychological outcomes in mind, because—all things being equal—our patients and their families will likely prefer treatments that improve quality of life ; “mortality rates alone are no longer a sufficient guide to quality of care” . More than any of the above, however, is potential for collaboration in addressing outcomes in both patients (PICS) and their family members (i.e., PICS-F). Multidisciplinary post-ICU clinics —as in the THRIVE initiative—may be a valuable objective within neurocritical care. However, current efforts at preventive interventions for patients alone, without including the caregiver, have not been successful in preventing chronic emotional distress in patients . Upon critical reflection, this makes sense given research showing that patient and caregiver coping and emotional distress are interrelated and may travel together over time . Many caregivers feel that they are not always understanding the needs of the patient , and this negatively impacts their mood and the care they provide . Additionally, the quality of care that a caregiver provides influences the trajectory of psychiatric illness in patients [126–128]; for example, overprotection and patronization LaBuzetta et al. Page 11 Neurocrit Care. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2020 June 01. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript predict greater depression in patients . Caregiver psychological distress also affects the functional and psychosocial recovery of the patient  (as well as medical costs insofar as caregivers’ poor mental health is associated with patients’ rehospitalization and increased health-related costs [131–133]). A recent systematic review from the American Heart Association recommended that interventions during stroke recovery should be dyadic (patient and caregiver together) and should address patient and caregiver outcomes (rather than just teaching caregivers how to help patients, or how to cope with caring for patients) . We believe this dyadic framework is applicable to all NeuroICU diagnoses. Given that emotional distress at hospitalization is the best predictor of future emotional distress  in both patients and their families, a focus on prevention may be the most efficient and effective way to improve outcomes in both patients and caregivers. The level of patient involvement will depend on degree of neurologic impairment; for those with cognitive deficits, skills such as mindfulness meditation can be emphasized. Early dyadic interventions starting at hospitalization and focusing on skills such as resiliency and interpersonal communication are underway in some institutions, including Massachusetts General Hospital’s “Recovering Together” initiative , which was developed through qualitative feedback from dyads and nurses . Pilot data show good feasibility and improvement in emotional distress and resiliency, with a subsequent single-blind randomized controlled trial funded by the National Institute of Nursing Research underway. As critical care physicians, we need to unite our efforts to develop interventions that address the “critical care experience” and its effect on patients and caregivers regardless of the acute injury. Given the interrelation among patient and caregiver factors, the documented chronicity of depression, anxiety, and PTS, and the interaction between the physical, emotional, and cognitive recovery in PICS and PICS-F, we recommend the development of screening methods to identify dyads of patients and caregivers who are at risk, and the development of preventive, tailored interventions for these dyads. Both NeuroICU survivors and caregivers definitively deserve our attention on long-term recovery and the prospect of a better life.',\n",
       " 'Introduction Patient-centered care (PCC) is essential to improving patient experiences and care quality, as it considers individual patient preferences, needs, and values. Cultural differences and language barriers in acutely hospitalized patients can result in multiple challenges in patient care and communication, rendering patients and their families more vulnerable at a critical time.

DOI  sufficiently address the complex needs of members of immigrant communities . Increasing evidence suggests that our effectiveness as physicians is related to our ability to understand and connect with our patients, including their language and cultural and religious aspects . At our institution, culturally competent care of our increasingly diverse patient population, responsiveness to patients’ value-based needs, and a patient-centered approach to care are crucial aspects of high-quality care. The primary mission of Harborview Medical Center is to provide healthcare for the most vulnerable residents of King County, including immigrant communities and populations with Non-English language preference (NELP) . Our institution utilizes a Caseworker Cultural Mediator (CCM) program to bridge care and communication gaps for these populations . This CCM service serves NELP populations in five languages (Amharic, Cambodian/Khmer, Somali, Spanish, and Vietnamese: i.e., CCM consultation eligible patients). In addition to medical interpretation, CCM provides patient, healthcare provider, and community support. CCM contributes to the well-being and support of immigrant and refugee patients, families, and communities through a partnership that promotes culturally sensitive care by 1) providing interpretation services, 2) forming and maintaining partnerships with patients and their families, and facilitating their interactions with hospital staff, 3) providing information about cultural norms  and perceptions around health, illness, and community resources to healthcare providers, 4) advocating for patients and their families and their needs in the healthcare setting, and 5) community outreach to provide healthcare-related education. CCM services have important goals: a) supporting patients and their families during their hospitalization, b) facilitating therapeutic relationships and trust between patients, families, and the healthcare team . Their involvement may benefit patients and the healthcare system and may be helpful to hospitals that care for socially and culturally diverse populations . While there is data on the successes of cultural case workers in community outreach programs, specifically in increasing prenatal visits and reduction in HbAIc levels due to educational visits by bicultural/bilingual community health workers , there are no studies examining the involvement of CCMs in neurocritical care (NCC). When faced with acute neurological emergencies and life-or-death decisions facing prognostic uncertainty, it is critical to consider cultural norms and perceptions while communicating with patients and families . Based on two index cases involving NELP patients’ families and surrogate decision-makers experiencing conflict, leading to emotional distress for both the families and neurocritical care providers, a 3-phase quality improvement (QI) project was implemented in 2020 to 1) identify deficiencies and inconsistencies in end-of-life care and then to 2) develop and implement a consensus-based initiative to incorporate CCM involvement on our neurocritical care service. This article describes our experience developing and implementing the initiative to provide culturally sensitive care and examines the effect of a QI process on CCM involvement. We also aimed to characterize practice patterns and the impact of CCM consultation by assessing characteristics associated with CCM involvement and the impact of CCM involvement. Materials And Methods Institutional review board This study (STUDY00009382) was approved on March 1, 2022, by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Washington, and a waiver of consent was in place for a retrospective analysis of data gathered between 1/1/2014 and 1/31/2021. Study design and patient selection We assessed the involvement of CCM in primarily Amharic/Cambodian/Khmer/Somali/Spanish/Vietnamesespeaking adult patients at a 413-bed, level-I trauma and designated Comprehensive Stroke Center with a 30bed dedicated neurocritical care service. Patients were included and deemed “CCM eligible” if they or their families were identified as members of the respective community. We launched a quality improvement project in January 2019 to raise awareness and encourage healthcare providers to consider CCM referrals. The period of 1/1/2014 to 1/31/2018 was considered the pre-CCM project implementation period, and that between 1/1/2019 to 1/31/2021 was considered the post-CCM project implementation period. At our institution, CCM involvement can occur via 1) a request made by the healthcare team or 2) self-referral from the CCM team member after identifying the patient\\'s preferred language in the electronic medical records (EMR). For this study, we retrospectively identified all potentially eligible patients by electronic chart review and compared clinical characteristics and outcomes between eligible patients who received CCM consultation and those who did not. We also compared CCM referral patterns before and after implementing our QI project. Outcomes of interest The primary outcomes were 1) rates of CCM involvement before and after the implementation of the QI project, 2) Differences and outcomes between CCM-eligible patients who received CCM consultation versus those who didn’t, 3) Qualitative analysis of the CCM role, concerns shared by patients/families and support offered by the CCM team, which was gathered from CCM progress notes entered in the EMR and direct feedback from the CCM team. 2023 Lele et al. Cureus 15(4): e37687. DOI  2 of 14 The structure and function of the CCM team The CCM team comprises hospital employees representing five communities of NELP patients and families: Amharic, Cambodian/Khmer, Somali, Spanish, and Vietnamese. Each representative is proficient in the language, has been born in the respective country, and shares the same cultural background. All CCMs receive advanced training in medical interpretation, cultural mediation, and case management, understand the role of the community advisor as a resource person, understand the resources and roles of the health and social institutions in the local area, interact with health care professionals, and reviewing cases with medical staff . The CCM team is typically available for consultation with medical teams between Monday and Friday during the daytime. While not routinely available on the weekend, exceptions are made for complex cases, and the critical care team may contact the CCM team. As part of the internal CCM self-referral process, the CCM team reviews the list of all hospitalized patients daily to identify patients/families/surrogate decisionmakers they may be able to support. Following consultation or self-referral, the CCM approaches the patient/families/surrogate decision-maker, provides education regarding the role of the CCM team, and offers involvement of the CCM team. CCMs are responsible for documenting patient encounters in the EMR. Once a referral is received, and the family has agreed to CCM involvement, the CCM will meet with the care team and delineate an individualized plan regarding communication and multidisciplinary family meetings. During these meetings, families receive educational material related to critical illnesses or death by neurological criteria (DNC). Communication with the care team is essential to CCM workflow. CCM add themselves to the patient\\'s care team list in the EMR and document family meetings and phone calls with patients/families. This establishes continuity of care and informs other healthcare team members about their involvement. The workflow of the CCM encompasses the following standards of practice: Navigation, Case Management, Mediation/Advocacy, Education, and Interpretation. CCM seeks out resources in the patient’s community that provide cultural, religious, and social support and often partners with religious leaders. In addition to direct patient contact, CCM interacts with outside hospitals, schools, and social organizations and organizes health fairs in their communities. Thus, the CCMs offer a wrap-around service by connecting patients and families to internal and external resources. Outline of the QI project Figure 1 describes the three phases of the project. FIGURE 1: Phases and Timeline for the Neurocritical Care Service Caseworker Cultural Mediator (CCM) Involvement Project CCM: Caseworker Cultural Mediator; NCCS: Neurocritical Care Service Phase 0 consisted of a review of two index cases involving two patients belonging to NELP and CCM-eligible communities who were declared DNC, resulting in contentious discussions with the care team after the family had a difficult time coming to terms with the medical diagnosis. The CCM was involved late in the process after communication breakdowns had occurred and provided remediation support to healthcare providers and families. This was the first time our neurocritical care team recognized the importance of the CCM team’s expertise in supporting NELP patients and mediating conflict. Phase I consisted of several rounds of discussions between the neurocritical care team and members of the CCM team to delineate synergistic interactions between the CCM and the healthcare team. Initially, the author AVL met with the CCM team to obtain input regarding the perceptions of CCM-eligible patients 2023 Lele et al. Cureus 15(4): e37687. DOI  3 of 14 towards end-of-life care and DNC. Several themes emerged, such as insufficient time between admission and neurological prognostication, insufficient time for the family to process the loved one’s condition, and perceived lack of accommodation by the neurocritical care service of the requests by families/surrogate decision-makers towards the continuation of care/somatic support. At the end of these discussions, a plan was made to invite CCM team members to a monthly multidisciplinary neurocritical care service meeting to enhance regular dialogue between the CCM and neurocritical care teams. Phase II consisted of educational sessions with the CCM team. The neurocritical care service put together a proposal to incorporate the benefits of the CCM team in routine neurocritical care workflow. It was decided that prompt consultation with the CCM team would occur within 24 hours of the patient’s admission to the neurocritical care service. We created flyers that included the project proposal, contact information for the project leads from neurocritical care service and CCM teams, authors AVL and LAM, respectively, and held several educational sessions. Simultaneously at this time, the hospital’s DNC policy underwent a revision. Due to the two index cases, it was decided to include a multidisciplinary huddle before the initiation of DNC determination with the involvement of the CCM team before approaching families/surrogate decision-makers regarding DNC, as outlined in the World Brain Death Project . Phase III We collected data on the involvement of the CCM team, time from admission to the participation of the CCM team, as well as progress noted by CCM, neurocritical care service, nurses, and social workers. Data Collection Patient information and specific data were collected from the EMR and refined via a departmental database, Perioperative & Pain Initiatives in Quality Safety Outcome (PPIQSO). The data points collected were as follows: 1) Patient characteristics: age, sex, admitting diagnosis, race, ethnicity, preferred language, insurance carrier, admitting Glasgow Coma Scale score (GCS), the maximum (SOFA) scores, need and duration of mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital length of stay (LOS), all-cause in-hospital mortality, transition to comfort measures only (CMO) and DNC. 2) Caseworker cultural mediator (CCM) services: We screened the EMR for the consultation notes by members of the CCM team. We noted the date and time the first note was written and calculated the time since admission to the consultation note (in days). 3) Authors AVL and AB met with members of the CCM team over a Zoom TM (San Jose, CA, USA) conference call to obtain insight from CCM team members about a priori selected topics: 1) common concerns voiced by the CCM-eligible patients/families/surrogate decision makers, 2) common requests made by CCM-eligible patients/families as relayed by CCM team members, 3) and discussed proposed solutions. 4) Author AB extracted clinical notes for all CCM and neurocritical care service encounters for the corresponding days from the study participants from the electronic medical record and saved them as Microsoft Word documents. 5) We examined the notes for follow-up meetings with patients/families or a lack thereof. Statistical Analysis The descriptive analysis described the study cohort characteristics. Categorical variables were expressed as counts and percentages. The Shapiro-Wilk test was performed to examine the normality of distribution of continuous variables such as age, intensive care unit, and hospital length of stay expressed as mean+SD or median [interquartile range, IQR]. Differences between patient characteristics in the pre-and postimplementation periods were performed using a two-tailed t-test and Chi-square test and calculated odds ratios and 95% confidence interval (CI). We also compared the patients in whom CCM self-referral led to families declining their request to be involved in the patient\\'s care. We used the Chi-square test to understand the temporal trends in CCM involvement between 2014 and 2021. In multivariate models, we examined characteristics of patients who received CCM among CCM-eligible cases, associations between CCM involvement and transition to CMO, and associations between CCM involvement and ICU LOS after adjusting for age, admission GCS, mechanical ventilation, and maximum SOFA scores. We reported the results as adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and corresponding 95% CIs. Multivariate models were tested for Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test. A Bonferroni-corrected p-value of < 0.05 was considered to be 2023 Lele et al. Cureus 15(4): e37687. DOI  4 of 14 statistically significant. Qualitative analysis pertained to the common themes identified after discussion with CCM team members and after a review of clinical notes. We codified major and minor themes and presented them as counts and percentages. STATA version 15 (StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX, USA)/RStudio 1.554 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) was used for statistical analysis . Results Pre-implementation and post-implementation comparison Table 1 highlights differences in the characteristics of the patients before (n=579) and after implementation (n=369) of the neurocritical care service CCM involvement project. After both samples were matched for age, gender, admitting diagnoses, mechanical ventilation status, admission GCS, maximum SOFA scores, ICU/hospital LOS, and DNC, we observed two key differences. First, CCM involvement was higher in the post-implementation sample (22% vs. 6.91%, OR 3.78, 95% CI [2.53; 5.71], p < 0.001). Second, there were higher rates of CMO in the post-implementation sample (9.21% vs. 5.35%), OR 1.79 95% CI [1.08; 2.99], p=0.031). 2023 Lele et al. Cureus 15(4): e37687.

The median time from admission to CCM involvement was 2.2 days [IQR 8.95]. The time to CCM involvement in the pre-implementation (2.3 days [IQR 11.3]) and postimplementation period (2.3 days, [IQR 8.3]) was similar (p=0.25). Numerically, the time from admission to CCM involvement was shorter in patients who transitioned to CMO compared to those who didn’t (1.45 days [IQR 3.25] vs. 2.4 days [IQR 10.4]); however, this was not statistically significant (p=0.58). Differences between CCM-eligible patients with versus without CCM involvement Table 2 summarizes differences between patients with CCM involvement and those without CCM involvement among all CCM-eligible patients. Patients with CCM involvement were younger (49 [IQR 38,63] years vs. 56 [IQR 42,68] years), p=0.002), had greater illness severity (admission GCS 8.5 [IQR 3,14] vs. 14 [IQR 7,15], p < 0.001), higher SOFA scores (5 [IQR 2,8] vs. 4 [IQR 2,6], p=0.007), and more frequently required mechanical ventilation (67% vs. 40%, OR 3.07, 95% CI 2.06, 4.64]). Numerically, DNC patients were more likely to receive CCM involvement, but this was not statistically significant (5.79% vs. 3.87%, OR 1.55 [IQR 0.61,3.42], p=0.33). 2023 Lele et al.

Cureus 15(4): e37687. DOI  8 of 14 FIGURE 3: Multivariate analysis Examining Reasons for Caseworker Cultural Mediator Involvement in Neurocritical Care ICU: intensive care unit: SOFA: Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Associations between CCM involvement, CMO transitions, and ICU LOS Patients with CCM involvement had longer intensive care unit stay (5 [IQR 2,13] days vs. 3 [IQR 2,5] days) and hospital length of stay (18 [IQR 7,40] days vs. 7 [IQR 3,16] days), with higher all-cause mortality (20% vs. 12%, RR 1.83, 95% CI 1.09, 2.95), and with a higher rate of transition to CMO (11.6% vs. 6.2%, OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.03;3.66, p=0.045). However, in a multivariate model adjusting for age, mechanical ventilation, admission GCS, and maximum SOFA scores, CCM involvement was not associated with an increased likelihood of transition to CMO (aOR 1.53, 95 CI [0.64; 3.71], p = 0.34, Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test, p = 0.5432). Also, multivariate analysis adjusting for age, mechanical ventilation, admission GCS, and maximum SOFA scores suggested that CCM involvement was less likely to prolong ICU LOS (aOR 0.62, 95% CI [0.49;0.79], p=0.0001, Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test, p = 0.55). Qualitative analysis of CCM involvement As Figure 4 shows, there was a proactive approach by the CCM team to educate families about the role of CCM by self-referral (n=91, 75.2%). Only a minority of consultations originated from critical care physicians and nurses (n=28, 23.1%) and families (n=2, 1.65%). The proportion of self-referrals (pre: 75% vs. post: 75.3%), critical care physicians/nurses requests (pre: 22.5% vs. post: 23.5%), and family requests (pre: 2.5% vs. post: 1.2%) remained consistent in the pre-and post-QI project implementation periods. Overall, 38% (n=43) of CCM team referrals did not result in any follow-up requests by the family. The patients in whom family followed up with CCM team member were related to their admission GCS (OR 0.92, 95% CI [0.85,0.99], p=0.03), being mechanically ventilated (OR 2.66, 95% CI [1.22,5.92], p=0.02), and with all-cause in-hospital mortality (OR 2.76, 95% CI [1.05,8.29], p=0.04). 2023 Lele et al. Cureus 15(4): e37687. DOI  9 of 14 FIGURE 4: Caseworker Cultural Mediator Involvement Referral Patterns in Patients Requiring Neurological/Neurosurgical Critical Care CCMs reported providing cultural/emotional support (n=96, 79%), end-of-life counseling (n=16, 13%), provided conflict mediation (n=15, 12.4%), and facilitated goals of care meetings (n=4, 3.3%). Specifically, CCMs provided cultural and linguistic care mediation, facilitation of communication within the neurocritical care team and families, provision of resources for rehabilitation and long-term condition management, location of housing and long-term care facilities, providing letters of support for out-of-the-country family members wishing to travel to the United States, and advocating for patient and family wishes. CCMs also assisted with locating legal next of kin and in the determination of childcare for minors. Figure 5 highlights common concerns voiced by NELP patients/families and support provided by the CCM. The main areas of problems for which CCM provided support were as follows: families expressed feeling rushed in making life-or-death decisions, communication gaps, financial concerns due to different healthcare systems in the US compared to their native country, patients/families expressed feeling unsafe in a foreign country and feel excluded in treatment decisions and hospital stay. FIGURE 5: Common Concerns Voiced by Caseworker Cultural MediatorEligible Patients/Family and Solutions Proposed by the Caseworker Cultural Mediator Consultation We present themes and quotes from the CCM progress notes in Table 3, which highlight the common concerns and solutions provided by CCMs in the following areas: language barriers causing anxiety, inadequate housing, emotional distress due to patient\\'s condition, demographic and personal specifics of the patient, cultural values, legal, financial, and next-of-kin mediation, medical procedures, resources for patient families, the impact of COVID-19 visitation rules, and services to assist with external concerns. 2023 Lele et al.

Our main finding was that implementing the QI project was independently associated with increasing CCM involvement. Other results include 1) CCM involvement preferentially occurred in the NELP patients with higher illness severity, 2) CCMs were more likely to be involved with NELP patients undergoing a transition to CMO, and those with longer ICU LOS, however, when adjusted for illness severity, these associations became non-significant, 3) four out of ten attempts made by CCMs to reach out to the family to provide support were declined by the family, 4) CCMs reported providing cultural/emotional support, end-of-life counseling, conflict mediation, and facilitated goals of care meetings. A multiphase QI project successfully increased the involvement of CCMs in the care of NELP patients. The individualized awareness of and attention to the needs of patients provided with the help of cultural mediators is integral to understanding the unique needs of our increasingly diverse populace. Patient differences in race/ethnicity can affect patient evaluations of care in many ways, potentially resulting in healthcare disparities. In a study comparing patient-centered care from the viewpoint of cancer patients of different ethnicities and races, unmet needs for time to make decisions and provider interaction between visits emerged among Blacks and Caucasian patients. At the same time, value for optimism was observed among Hispanic patients . By creating awareness and bridging gaps in knowledge about the CCM team’s 2023 Lele et al. Cureus 15(4): e37687. DOI  12 of 14 role on the part of the healthcare team, we attempted to address the lack of guidelines and protocols regarding CCM consultation triggers and successfully reduced the potential for missed opportunities. However, more work needs to be done in this area. Given the low rate of CCM involvement and a sizeable NELP population that can potentially benefit, we suggest solutions to increase consistency and sustainability in the participation of the CCM team. These solutions are aimed at overcoming communication barriers and bridging cultural gaps. This could be achieved by monthly educational opportunities for neurocritical care healthcare providers, including mandatory virtual/on-demand training, setting up institutional guidelines, and a consultancy request through the EMR, which was not present at the time of the study. Finally, adequate hospital resources should be reserved for the growth and sustenance of the CCM team and for exploring ways to expand services to other NELP communities beyond those currently supported. Our study finds that CCM involvement was utilized for the sickest NELP patients and end-of-life support, including transitions to CMO and patients with longer ICU LOS. Since prognostication after neurological and neurosurgical emergencies often involves complex and time-sensitive conversations with the patients/families/surrogate decision makers, the CCM team may be seen as a “last resort” or after a communication breakdown with patient/patient families instead of employing a proactive approach to address and overcome language, cultural and religious barriers. This argument is highlighted by the two index cases where the CCM team had to resort to remediation regarding complex medical decision-making. Our study indicated that CCM involvement was not associated with an increased likelihood of CMO transitions and non-CMO in-hospital mortality when adjusted for illness severity. The project also highlights that within the construct of CMO discussions, without influencing the outcome (CMO or ICU LOS), the involvement of the CCM team may provide opportunities to provide culturally sensitive care to NCC patients in a time-sensitive manner. The majority of CCM involvements included a proactive approach by the CCM team to identify patients based on their preferred language listed in EMR. The CCM team members introduced themselves to the patients/families, educated them on the support that could be provided, and left their contact information. In a minority of cases, we found that the social worker/bedside nurse/case manager/primary critical care team members reached out to CCM. The few times the critical care team reached out to CCM were in the context of end-of-life support and DNC. One case of DNC highlighted challenges in the accommodation of family requests after the diagnosis of the DNC was completed by the neurocritical care service. It underlined the importance of a proactive multidisciplinary approach to culturally sensitive care, as highlighted and recommended in the World Brain Death Project . Medical care for NELP patients and families is stressful in various aspects, only one of which is the barrier of language . CCMs likely contribute to their sense of control and support and provide solutions to real problems such as finance and housing. We were surprised to find that 4 out of 10 self-referrals by the CCMs resulted in a lack of a request by the NELP families to seek the support of CCM. The exact reasons for this are unknown, but our study suggests that in patients with high illness severity, families may reach out to CCMs for support when faced with challenges related to end-of-life/goals of care conversations. Future studies may examine why NELP families may not seek CCM support in neurocritical care. Limitations Several limitations are apparent, mainly because this was a single-center, nonrandomized quality improvement project with before/after comparison. Most importantly, this project did not examine patient/family-centered outcomes; thus, it was impossible to compare perceptions of the family/surrogate decision-makers towards culturally sensitive care provided with and without the involvement of CCMs. This low rate may be multifactorial such as lack of awareness and participation of CCMs only if there is a conflict between the neurocritical care provider and the families/surrogate decision makers. Another limitation of the current system at HMC for CCMs to know about potential patients/family needing their services (proactive approach) is that the CCMs only know of patients needing their services based on the patient\\'s language as listed in the EMR, which may not always be recorded accurately. It does not factor in their families’ preferred language. Unless CCMs get a referral from a critical care team member, the CCM team may be unable to identify these families prospectively. Hence, the results from our study may not be generalizable to adult NCC patients outside our hospital but provide a benchmark for other hospitals and neurocritical care units/services to compare against. Conclusions A local QI project rollout increased the involvement of CCMs in neurocritical care. This project attempts to create awareness among neurocritical care healthcare providers on ways to support NELP patients and families of different cultural backgrounds. The study results are encouraging, and there is potential to spread this awareness to other NELP patients/families and contexts other than critical care environments. The lessons learned from this study informed the neurocritical care and CCM team members that 1) NELP patients/families need support in many areas, support that typically is not provided by a medical interpreter, 2) there may be patients/families that may decline to follow up with a CCM team member, 3) high illness severity, end-of-life and goals of care conversations may be seen as triggers for CCM support, and 4) If CCM 2023 Lele et al. Cureus 15(4): e37687. DOI  13 of 14 resources are limited then we may focus attention on these areas of need to maintain the sustainability of CCM team to provide culturally sensitive care. The perceptions of NELP patients/families regarding routine involvement of CCM in neurocritical care and its impact deserve further examination.

       " 'Introduction Psychological distress including anxiety, depression and stress in family members of intensive-care-unit (ICU) patients is a welldocumented phenomenon across a wide variety of countries including, but not limited to, Brazil, Italy, China, Greece, France, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States (Chiang et al., 2016; Davidson et al., 2012; Fumis et al., 2015; Jones et al., 2012; Konstanti et al., 2016; Mistraletti et al., 2016; Pochard et al., 2001). Family members may show psychological distress when trying to comprehend simple concepts (Rutherford and von Wenckstern, 2016) such as that of time. For example, in one clinical instance experienced by the ﬁrst author, a family was repeatedly unable to grasp the concept of time regarding when the end of a nurse’s shift occurred; yet, this same family was asked to make crucial life or death decisions. This clinical example embodies what is now known from scientiﬁc advances in neurobiology, which demonstrates that humans under stress have a reduced recall capacity and recognition performance (Schwabe et al., 2012). A family member’s ICU admission is a stressful event, which was conﬁrmed via saliva cortisol levels by Turner-Cobb et al. (2016); however, for some family members, the stress experienced exceeds the expected acute stress reaction and may actually lead to the development of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) Sundararajan et al., 2014). The overstimulating inﬂuence of technology present in the ICU environment was identiﬁed as a contributing factor to psychological distress in family members of an ICU patient (Fumis and Deheinzelin, 2009). Researchers have conceptualised this persistent psychological distress experienced by family members of ICU patients as Postintensive Care Syndrome–Family (PICS-F; Davidson et al., 2012).

The COVID-19 pandemic has further intensified this experience in addition to exacerbating clinician and resident burnout. To ameliorate some of these concerns, a team of resident and medical student trainees implemented a virtual shared medical appointment (vSMA) program for inpatients with acute cerebrovascular disorders and their caregivers. The authors hypothesized that an early intervention in the form of a vSMA improves patient and caregiver health literacy and preparedness while simultaneously educating clinical trainees on effective communication skills and reducing clinician burnout. METHODS\\u2002 Patients and caregivers of admitted patients were identified through a census of neurosurgery, neurocritical care, and neurology electronic medical records. A weekly 60-minute secure virtual session consisted of introductions and a 10-minute standardized presentation on cerebrovascular disease management, followed by participant-guided discussion. Participants completed presession and postsession surveys. Through this small feasibility study data were obtained regarding present challenges, both expected and unforeseen. RESULTS\\u2002 A total of 170 patients were screened, and 13 patients and 26 caregivers participated in at least 1 vSMA session. A total of 6 different healthcare providers facilitated sessions. The vSMA program received overwhelmingly positive feedback from caregivers. Survey responses demonstrated that 96.4% of caregivers and 75% of patients were satisfied with the session, 96.4% of caregivers and 87.5% of patients would recommend this type of appointment to a friend or family member, and 88.8% of providers reported feeling validated by conducting the session. The participant group had a 20% greater percentage of patients discharged home without home needs compared to the nonparticipant group. The primary obstacles encountered included technological frustrations with the consent process and the sessions themselves. CONCLUSIONS\\u2002 Implementation of a vSMA program at a tertiary care center during a pandemic was feasible. Themes caregivers expressed on the postsession survey included better understanding of caring for a stroke patient and coping with the unpredictability of a patient’s prognosis. The pandemic has precipitated shifts toward telehealth, but this study highlights the importance of avoiding marginalization of elderly and less technologically inclined populations.  KEYWORDS\\u2002 shared medical appointment; telehealth; stroke; health literacy; resident burnout; patient-provider relationship Neurosurg Focus\\u2002 Volume 52 • June 2022 1 ©AANS 2022, except where prohibited by US copyright law Unauthenticated | Downloaded 01/17/26 10:55 PM UTC Mahajan et al. Neurosurg Focus\\u2002 Volume 52 • June 2022 2 S hared medical appointments (SMAs) are an evidenced-based practice defined as group-based clinical appointments that bring together patients with similar medical conditions.1 The sessions are typically mediated by healthcare providers and integrate clinical, psychological, and socioeconomic aspects of disease management. SMAs have been found to have positive effects on quality measures. They have been reported to enhance the patientclinician relationship and improve patient perceptions of providers and health systems.2 By sharing experiences and learning from peers, patients report an improved capacity for self-advocacy. From a provider perspective, SMAs increase efficiency, reduce redundancy, and educate providers on what patients care about.3 The use of a group dynamic alters the traditional power structure between clinician and patient, with the belief that patients will feel more empowered to verbalize questions, issues, and success stories.4 For patients with cerebrovascular diseases, a diagnosis is often made in the acute inpatient setting after an ischemic or hemorrhagic event.5 For this reason, we sought to conduct a pilot SMA for patients with cerebrovascular disease in an inpatient setting. Given the neurological sequelae often associated with this disease, in this pilot study we also sought to engage caregivers early in the course of treatment. The study, initially designed to be performed with in-person SMAs, coincided with the COVID pandemic and the meetings were ultimately transformed into virtual SMAs (vSMAs). The objective of this pilot was to develop a care pathway to improve patient and caregiver health literacy, selfefficacy, and satisfaction. We hoped that a vSMA conducted as an early intervention would help patients and caregivers learn to understand and manage their disease process and feel more comfortable navigating a complex healthcare system. Secondary objectives were to reduce healthcare provider burnout through a more humanistic approach to patient care. Methods This study received grant funding from the American College for Graduate Medical Education. Institutional review board approval was obtained from University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center. For study enrollment, patients with an admission longer than 24 hours as well as caregivers of admitted patients were screened through the neurosurgery, neurocritical care, and neurology electronic medical record census. Paid medical student research assistants performed the census of patient data and contacted families for enrollment. Inclusion criteria are shown in Table 1. All patients underwent a capacity assessment prior to enrollment. A patient’s declination to participate or failure of capacity assessment did not preclude caregiver participation. Participants received $60 in gift cards for their participation in the study ($10 before survey completion and $50 after completion of both the vSMA session and postsession survey). Repeat participants were permitted. Facilitators were volunteers who were selected prior to the session and included neurosurgical and neurology trainees (residents and fellows), advanced practice providers, and nurses. The vSMA meetings were structured as follows. Weekly 60-minute secure virtual Zoom (2021 Zoom Video Communications, Inc.) sessions were conducted for 10 weeks. The session consisted of introductions and a 10-minute standardized presentation on cerebrovascular disease management, followed by participant-guided discussion. The facilitator was provided with a fidelity checklist containing leading questions to stimulate conversation. Safety checklists were completed, which included items for monitoring disputes between participants, neurological or mental status changes in patients, or any safety concerns during the session. Facilitators received $75 in gift cards upon completion of all surveys and facilitation tasks. Participant Outcomes Participants completed surveys before and after vSMAs. The postsession survey included Likert scale questionnaires regarding satisfaction with the session, educational value of the session, and recommendations of the session to family and friends. Patients also answered questions regarding their level of health literacy. Caregivers completed questions on their level of preparedness for caregiving. Facilitators completed questions regarding burnout, as have been utilized in past studies on healthTABLE 1.

Results A total of 170 patients and their caregivers were screened, and 13 patients and 26 caregivers participated in the vSMAs. A total of 6 different healthcare providers (2 neurocritical fellows, 2 neurosurgery residents, 1 neurosurgery fellow, and 1 intensive care unit nurse practitioner) facilitated the sessions. There was a mix of participants, including patients who participated without their caregivers and caregivers who participated alone, as well as patients and caregivers who participated together (Table 2). More caregivers than patients were enrolled. Four participating families had more than 1 caregiver participant. One patient participated 3 times. Baseline demographic and clinical outcome data of participants, participants with a caregiver, and nonparticipants are presented in Table 3. The participant group had a 20% greater percentage of patients discharged home without home needs than the other two groups. Patients and caregivers completed pre- and postsession surveys, which allowed the study team to qualitatively identify baseline concerns and benefits gained from the session. Major concerns voiced in the presession survey among caregivers were a desire to understand the complete treatment plan, mental health needs of the patient, and what to expect with the recovery process. Survey outcomes are presented in Table 4. Among caregivers, 96.4% reported being satisfied with the session and would recommend this type of appointment to a friend or family member. Among patients, 75% reported being satisfied with the educational session and felt the session provided information that they needed to manage their condition at home, was effective at teaching or reinforcing information they already knew, covered all the information they needed, and answered their questions, and 87.5% of patients would recommend this type of appointment to a friend or family member. Among providers, 100% reported that conducting the session improved the medical care of patients and was not a waste of their time or patients’ time, and 88.5% of providers felt that conducting the session made them feel validated. With regard to outcomes measured in preand postsession surveys, small increases were seen in the health literacy of patients (16.3 ± 2.7 vs 17.1 ± 2.1), caregiver preparedness (26.6 ± 6.7 vs 26.7 ± 5.8), and provider burnout (29.8 ± 3.2 vs 30.2 ± 2.6). In the postsession survey, caregivers were most concerned with the transition from hospital to home, caregiver well-being, financial stressors, and the coordination of follow-up care. Participants reported feeling more educated after a vSMA in terms of acquiring the tools to tend to the needs of the patient. Free-text responses that caregivers wrote on their pre- and postsession surveys are included in Table 5. Discussion We report the qualitative results, thematic content analysis, and lessons learned from a 10-week vSMA pilot study targeting patients with cerebrovascular disorders, their caregivers, and the clinician trainees treating this patient population. Although not powered for statistical significance, the pilot program received positive feedback from participants. The pilot study served to underscore important thematic challenges relevant to providing care for neurologically ill patients in a healthcare system that is increasingly prioritizing telemedicine. Here, we outline the major challenges we faced and future directions for this undertaking. Implementation of a vSMA program at a tertiary care center during a pandemic was feasible. Our limited survey data demonstrated that participation in vSMA sessions may increase health literacy in patients and preparedness in caregivers and reduce burnout in providers. Given that most participants attended 1–2 sessions, we did not expect to see large or significant differences in survey data. We did observe very positive results via survey questions. Most caregivers and patients were satisfied with the vSMA sessions and would recommend this type of virtual appointment to a friend or family member. All providers felt that this program improved the care of patients and was a meaningful use of their time for both themselves and their patients, and the majority of providers felt validated by conducting the session. We also observed that patients who participated or had a family member participating had a 20% higher rate of discharge to home than patients TABLE 2.

Of note, most of the participants were enrolled prior to discharge. However, this characteristic may have been due to participant bias such that higher-functioning patients were more able to participate. Additionally, patients who were going home may have been more motivated to participate themselves or more likely to have family participation in our sessions in order to be better prepared and more informed on care needs at home, which we found was a common discussion theme. The home discharge rate of participants with caregiver participation was nearly the same as the rate for those who did not participate. The caregiver participation group did not include the patients who chose to participate themselves without a caregiver, and thus may have been skewed in terms of baseline patient functioning. A search through the written responses in the pre- and postsession surveys revealed the major concerns expressed by patients and caregivers. Recurring topics included seeking a better understanding of the treatment plan, managing mental well-being for both patients and caregivers, how to motivate a patient, the recovery and rehabilitation process, and managing frustrations and expectations of friends and family. Indeed, poststroke depression occurs in a significant number of patients and leads to greater disability.8 Themes caregivers expressed on the postsession survey included better understanding of caring for a stroke patient and coping with the unpredictability of a patient’s prognosis. It appears that the sessions may have tempered expectations for many caregivers regarding rapid recovery of loved ones. Thematic topics observed during the sessions themselves seemed to be centered around patient mood and communication. Families shared solutions for how to improve communication with loved ones, including using pictural cards, and facilitators directed families to online resources available from stroke and dementia associations. Enrollment and Pandemic Timing The launch of this study, which was originally planned for face-to-face meetings, coincided with the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Daily modifications in visitor status and resident schedules, coupled with the increased dependence on recruitment by phone over face-to-face encounters, posed challenges to recruitment efforts. During the no-visitor policy, enrollment was enhanced by the limited contact of caregivers with hospital staff and their loved ones. People had begun to work from home, caregivers had more schedule flexibility, and importantly, families were desperate for any information on hospitalized family members, including possibly seeing their loved ones virtually. Interest waned with the introduction of a single-visitor policy. Interpersonal Connection Virtual sessions can alter the safety and security felt during a group session. With the virtual platform, concerns exist about health information security breaches, which along with outside distractions can prevent participants from fully interacting during sessions.9,10 Empathy and understanding can be difficult to convey in a virtual platform.11 Nonetheless, past studies have shown that virtual sessions decrease disease-related stressors, possibly through increasing accessibility to health information.12,13 We were able to observe very tangible emotions, frustrations, and empathy shared between struggling families. Access and Marginalization The use of virtual technology served to increase access for many individuals. However, an unintended consequence was the marginalization of populations who lacked access to smart technology. Digital divides are known to exist within socioeconomic strata and generational age groups.14,15 Solutions we implemented to improve access included creating continuity through the use of a recurring Zoom link for every week, the development and distribution of a picture-based navigational manual depicting how to log in from the emailed link, and physically setting up the session for participants in the hospital. Despite these multipronged efforts, technology posed a major hindrance in study participation. Persisting roadblocks included participants who were unable to log in, sit in front of their screens, or correctly use cameras; confusion over use of TABLE 5. Representative examples of participant goals and expectations for vSMA sessions Before vSMA Session After vSMA Session • “Understanding the complete treatment plan and helping father understand” • “The mental health for both the patient and care giver” • “Now that I am home with my Mom, it is more difficult than I was expecting. She is less capable than what I thought. All she wants to do is sleep. How can I get her more motivated?” • “I would like to learn more about next steps in the rehab process and how we can best prepare our home for his eventual discharge home” • “How to deal with setbacks of the loved one” • “Managing friends and family; their expectations and actions” • “This session provided an opportunity to validate and/or understand information regarding care of a [stroke] patient.” • “Perhaps it is just my temperament, but I wish that I had some idea of what her condition will be in the future. […] I know that I am not unique and I will be patient.” • “I really got a lot out of the group. I was glad the Dr educated everyone re: aneurysms/AVM. […] Our situation has a high degree of stress added financially as well as emotionally for this unanticipated event. […] Have not yet figured out how to go about this and interested in how others proceed.” • “My biggest anxiety is the unknown.

Many screened caregivers did not have telephone access, used only analog or flip phones, or had work obligations. Previous studies have shown that caregivers with greater financial pressure face greater stress, particularly when caring for disabled patients with stroke.16 Thus, it is imperative to find innovative ways of outreach to assist these populations who continue to face barriers to telemedicine care. Challenges With Scheduling It was challenging for younger caregivers to attend sessions held during working hours, whereas evening hours were challenging for patients and older individuals. One objective of the study was to reduce clinical burnout through building relationships with patients and caregivers. Clinical obligations impeded the recruitment of a larger number of resident surgical trainees as facilitators. Residents who did participate found benefit and enjoyed facilitating the sessions, but for many other residents it was not a high priority despite monetary incentives. While certain studies have demonstrated that utilization of telemedicine or SMAs can lead to decreased burnout,17,18 participation in this study did not necessarily reduce workload or increase efficiency for clinicians. Integration of the information provided by this pilot study into permanent metrics such as billing advantages, reduction in time spent in individual family conversations, and increased patient and family satisfaction may better incentivize trainees or faculty. Outpatient SMAs are most often run by advanced practice practitioners for cost purposes and such a program, whether inpatient or outpatient, might benefit from a more stable and available facilitating team. Managing Expectations For this pilot initiative, the medical students who performed the census of patient data and contacted families for enrollment were paid research assistants. However, although the task was expected to be brief, it became onerous as a significant amount of time was spent explaining the study objectives and conducting multiple callbacks. Despite these efforts, many patients and their families were absent even though they completed enrollment. Several caregivers presumed the session would consist of a personal meeting with the physician conducted at the patient bedside. Increased clarity and a more streamlined process could ensure sustainability and increase satisfaction of clinicians as well as caregivers and patients. Other Considerations Given the brevity of the pilot study, participants generally attended 1–2 sessions. The intention was to include participants in different phases of their medical journey, from critical care unit to hospital floor, through discharge to rehabilitation, and in the months recovering at home. By creating a temporal layering effect with participants sharing experiences at different stages, we hoped to increase engagement, learning, and preparedness.4 When this did occur, participants reported finding the sessions to be incredibly informative. Finally, in the future, given the virtual nature of the program, incorporating stroke patients at satellite or community hospitals may allow for an even greater reach and volume of participants.19 Conclusions With the more than 10-fold increase in virtual visits due to their increasing importance during the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent continued use as an adjunct to on-site clinical contact, implementing effective vSMA visits will be of greater importance in the future.20 Although our data showed limited outcome improvements, given the pilot nature of this study the results provide a sense of optimism. Despite the identified implementation challenges, the pilot program garnered positive feedback. Future efforts to increase access for marginalized populations and identify optimal metrics to assess quality and clinical outcomes are important to exploring the potential benefits of vSMAs in serving the needs of patients with acute illnesses that have chronic effects.

       " 'Introduction Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major health concern due to its poor clinical and functional outcome and its impact on family homeostasis. Often, the stressed and anxious family is not involved in the care process until the rehabilitation phase. This study aimed to evaluate the integration of family involvement in the neuro-intensive care of TBI patients on family satisfaction. Materials and methods This pre-test-post-test quasi-experimental study involved 70 families of moderate and severe TBI patients, divided equally into experimental and control groups. A guideline, Family Involvement in the Care of TBI (FIC-TBI), was developed. The key elements of this guideline were structured communication, participation in basic care, and shared decision-making. FIC-TBI was integrated into the critical care management of TBI. The impact of FIC-TBI was evaluated using the Family Satisfaction in the ICU Care Unit 24R (FS-ICU 24R) tool. Results Data analysis was done through paired and unpaired t-tests as well as analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). The results showed statistically significant differences in the post-test family satisfaction scores between the experimental and control groups. The adjusted mean satisfaction scores of components such as satisfaction with care (F(1, N-2)=984.63; p<0.001), satisfaction with decision-making (F(1, N-2)=1489.63; p<0.001), and overall satisfaction (F(1, N-2)=712.87; p<0.001) were higher in the experimental group. The study found a significant correlation between family satisfaction levels and variables such as gender and education. Conclusions This study was done with the objective to evaluate the impact of integration of family involvement into the neuro-intensive care of TBI on family satisfaction. The findings demonstrated that the FIC-TBI guideline improved satisfaction across multiple dimensions, such as care, communication, decision-making, and overall experience. The study also found a significant correlation between family satisfaction and gender and education. This study emphasized the importance of early family involvement in critical care settings as a vital component of holistic TBI management.

This heightened concern stems from several critical factors, including its high mortality and morbidity rates, the disproportionate impact on young adults, poor clinical and functional recovery outcomes, and the profound disruption it causes to family life and quality of living . The complexity of TBI management necessitates specialized care, typically provided within neuro-intensive care units (neuro-ICUs).

(November 29, 2024) Integrating Family Involvement in Neuro-Intensive Care: A Pathway to Enhanced Family Satisfaction in Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Management. Cureus 16(11): e74748. DOI  highlight that TBI is one of the most frequently encountered conditions in neuro-ICUs, often accompanied by a surge of family members seeking information and reassurance about their loved ones . The emergency nature of TBI, coupled with the urgent and complex medical decisions required, often leaves families unprepared to navigate such a critical health crisis. Factors such as limited visitation opportunities, fear of losing their loved one, and the overwhelming stress of the situation significantly contribute to their emotional distress . These challenges frequently result in heightened interactions between families and neuro-ICU staff. However, communication in these scenarios is often brief, focused primarily on clinical facts, and leaves little opportunity for families to express their emotions or seek psychological support from the staff . While TBI treatment has traditionally prioritized clinical recovery, growing evidence emphasizes the importance of addressing the psychological and emotional well-being of both patients and their families as integral to successful outcomes . Families increasingly desire greater involvement in the care process, and their interactions with healthcare providers play a pivotal role in shaping treatment experiences and outcomes . Research indicates that when families are actively involved in essential care within the neuro-ICU, both patient recovery and family satisfaction improve significantly . The introduction of protocols that emphasize effective communication, structured family involvement, and shared decision-making is essential for creating a supportive care environment. Such protocols not only uphold the rights of patients but also alleviate the psychological burden on families, fostering trust and satisfaction in the care process . Family involvement extends beyond providing emotional support. It includes participation in basic patient care, engaging in care planning discussions, and assisting the healthcare team in tailoring interventions based on the patient\\'s preferences. This collaboration not only empowers families to cope with stress but also helps multidisciplinary teams deliver more patient-centered care . Studies have shown that involving families in communication and care planning significantly reduces their levels of anxiety and depression while enhancing their overall experience in the ICU . Additionally, family involvement ensures continuity of care, which is particularly vital for TBI patients, many of whom face prolonged physical and cognitive rehabilitation challenges . In recent years, family satisfaction has emerged as a critical measure of quality in critical care settings. Research consistently demonstrates that improved communication, shared decision-making, and active family participation are associated with higher levels of satisfaction. A meta-analysis of family-centered care models revealed notable reductions in stress levels and enhanced satisfaction among families involved in the care process . This study explores the impact of structured family involvement in the care of TBI patients on family satisfaction. It forms part of a larger initiative aimed at developing and evaluating the Neuro Intensive Care Protocol for TBI (NICP-TBI). A key component of this protocol is the Family Involvement in the Care of TBI (FIC-TBI), which provides clear guidelines for structured communication, participation in basic care, and shared decision-making . By integrating family involvement into TBI management, this study seeks to advance understanding and improve outcomes in neurocritical care settings. Materials And Methods This prospective pre-test-post-test quasi-experimental study was done in the neuro-ICUs of Tellicherry Cooperative Hospital and Indira Gandhi Co-operative Hospital Thalassery between June 2022 and May 2024. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the impact of the integration of family involvement in the care of TBI patients on family satisfaction. The study involved 70 families of TBI patients, equally distributed to experimental and control groups. This study was part of a broader study titled \"Development, validation, and evaluation of a neuro intensive care protocol for TBI (NICP -TBI)\". FIC-TBI was one of the components of the NICP-TBI. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee (IEC) of Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education and Research (approval number: IEC/21/OCT/165/69). All samples were given participant information sheets and informed consent. Selection of sample Family members of adult patients with moderate (Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score 9-12) or severe (GCS score ≤8) TBI undergoing treatment in the neuro-ICU for more than 48 hours were considered eligible samples. Convenience sampling was adopted as the sampling technique. Description of intervention FIC-TBI Guideline The broader components of the guideline were structured communication, participation in basic care, and shared decision-making.

Team meeting TABLE 1: FIC-TBI model framework for neuro-ICU TBI management FIC-TBI: Family Involvement in the Care of TBI; neuro-ICU: neuro-intensive care unit; TBI: traumatic brain injury Data collection and study process In the study, 35 participants in the control group received standard information concerning their relatives admitted to the neuro-ICU. Family satisfaction was initially assessed 24 hours post-admission using the Family Satisfaction in the ICU Care Unit 24R (FS-ICU 24R) scale. Routine care practices and family communication processes were maintained throughout the neuro-ICU stay, with a second assessment conducted upon patient transfer from the neuro-ICU. For the experimental group, a structured guideline titled \"Family Involvement in the Care of TBI (FIC-TBI)\" was introduced to the neuro-ICU\\'s multidisciplinary healthcare team before study initiation. This intervention was launched through a workshop, where neuro-ICU professionals practiced the care model with standardized patient and family scenarios and were evaluated using a scoring sheet. An initial satisfaction assessment was performed 24 hours after neuro-ICU admission. Subsequently, the FIC-TBI guideline was systematically integrated into TBI management. A final satisfaction assessment using FS-ICU 24R was conducted after each patient\\'s neuro-ICU stay. Results Description of sample characteristics in the experimental and control groups The study included a total of 70 participants, equally distributed between the experimental group (n=35) and the control group (n=35). A comparative analysis of the baseline characteristics revealed that both groups were generally comparable across most demographic variables, such as gender, age distribution, relationship with the patient, and previous ICU experience. However, a statistically significant difference was observed in the educational status of participants between the two groups (p=0.03). This indicates that the two groups were otherwise homogenous, with education being the only exception. The detailed breakdown of the characteristics is presented in Table 2. 2024 Mathew et al.

The results of the study are aligned with research studies on family-centered care models in critical care, which highlighted family inclusion\\'s benefits for both patients and their families. This study showed a significant improvement in the care satisfaction scores in the experimental group (mean increase from 48.79 to 98.27; p<0.001). This finding is consistent with a study by Davidson et al., which emphasized how family-centered approaches addressed the psychological needs of families, reducing their anxiety and promoting a more inclusive environment . Similarly, Coombs et al. found that effective communication fosters a sense of partnership between family members and healthcare providers, thereby increasing satisfaction . 2024 Mathew et al. Cureus 16(11): e74748. DOI  6 of 9 In terms of decision-making satisfaction, our study findings align closely with the findings of a study by Curtis and White, which documented that involving family members in decision-making processes leads to greater clarity and satisfaction with care outcomes . Olding et al. also highlighted the importance of family engagement in critical decisions, which is associated with improved family understanding and comfort in a critical care setting . The correlation analysis in this study indicated that family satisfaction is significantly associated with demographic factors such as gender and education. This analysis indicates the importance of considering demographic factors in understanding and improving satisfaction with critical care. Mitchell and Aitken\\'s research similarly found that demographic characteristics influence family needs and their perception of ICU care quality, and the study suggested the necessity of a structured approach to meet diverse family expectations . Adams et al. echoed these findings, noting that understanding family characteristics can enhance satisfaction by facilitating customized support . Study limitations This study has certain limitations that could affect the generalizability of the results. The relatively small sample size (n=70) may limit the statistical power when applied to broader populations or different neuroICU settings. The use of self-reported measures through the FS-ICU 24R tool could introduce bias, as participants may feel inclined to respond positively due to perceived social expectations. To validate the statistically significant results of FIC-TBI guidelines, multicenter studies across diverse settings are needed. Conclusions In this study, we investigated the impact of the integration of structured family involvement in the care of TBI patients in the neuro-ICU and its correlation with family satisfaction. A total of 70 families of TBI patients were surveyed to evaluate the effects of this approach. This study demonstrated that integrating structured family involvement using the FIC-TBI guidelines significantly enhances family satisfaction in neuro-ICU settings. This study\\'s findings indicated that structured communication, participation in care, and shared decision-making are the key elements in improving family satisfaction across various dimensions, including care quality and decision-making processes. The correlation with demographic factors like gender and education, found in the study, highlights the need for incorporating a holistic approach and personalized family support strategies in neurocritical care. Future research should expand on the findings with larger, multicenter studies to further validate the impact on long-term patient outcomes and adapt the guidelines to diverse cultural settings.

       " 'Introduction Admission to the neurological intensive care unit (Neuro-ICU) is often characterized by periods of uncertainty about survival and long-term prognosis, which is stressful for patients and their family caregivers (i.e., family or friends who provide the bulk of unpaid care). Unsurprisingly, rates of clinically significant anxiety symptoms are high among neurocritical care patients (20–43%) [1–3] and their caregivers (18–46%) [3–5]. Prospective studies of survivors of critical illness have demonstrated that anxiety rates remain elevated well beyond hospital admission . This is particularly concerning given that anxiety has been associated with greater risk of major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events and mortality in critically ill patients . In caregivers, chronic anxiety has been associated with caregiver strain and depression . Resiliency, a multidimensional biopsychosocial construct defined as the ability to successfully adapt and recover from adversity or trauma , has been consistently linked to a variety of positive health outcomes [11–13]. Mindfulness and coping strategies are Meyers et al. Page 2 Neurocrit Care. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2025 May 06. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript two modifiable resilience factors. Mindfulness, or nonjudgmental awareness and focus on the present in the face of adversity , has been inversely associated with anxiety symptoms in a cross-sectional dyadic study of neurocritical care patients and their family caregivers during hospitalization . Mindfulness-based interventions have effectively improved stress, psychological symptoms, and quality of life for caregivers of patients with neurodegenerative disease . Coping strategies, defined as the cognitive, behavioral, and emotional skills that individuals draw on during times of stress, are also linked to positive psychological and physical health outcomes . In medical populations, adults with chronic myofascial pain who rely on adaptive coping strategies such as emotioncentered coping have been found to experience less affective pain and depressive symptoms . Couples undergoing unsuccessful treatment for infertility who use emotion-centered coping strategies have been shown to suffer less psychological distress in both individuals . In Neuro-ICU patients and caregivers, poor coping strategies have been associated with increased global emotional distress and elevated psychiatric symptoms . An increasing body of the literature acknowledges that patient and caregiver resiliency factors and symptoms are interdependent, with each individual’s adjustment to medical illness impacting their partners’ adjustment [19–21]. For example, in a cross-sectional study of Neuro-ICU patients and caregivers, depression symptoms have been shown to be interdependent between patients and caregivers, and high mindfulness in either the patient or caregiver has been associated with lower depression symptoms in both self and partner . Accordingly, current guidelines recommend assessing patient and caregiver factors at the dyadic level (i.e., patient and caregiver together) . However, the longer-term trajectory of anxiety symptoms in Neuro-ICU survivors and their family caregivers, the impact of psychological resilience on that trajectory, and the nuanced role of the dyad in the development of chronic anxiety symptoms remain unclear. The current study seeks to fill this gap by first examining the longitudinal trajectory of anxiety symptoms in neurocritical care patients and their caregivers and then exploring prospectively the synergistic relationship between resiliency factors and anxiety in patient– caregiver dyads. We hypothesize that for both patient and caregiver, anxiety symptoms will be predictive of one’s own level of anxiety at the subsequent assessment, and that resiliency factors will be negatively associated with one’s own anxiety symptoms across all time points. Further, we hypothesize that for both patients and caregivers, anxiety symptoms and resiliency factors will be interdependent, with one’s own anxiety symptoms predicting a higher level of symptoms in their partner and one’s own resilience being associated with lower levels of anxiety symptoms in their partner at follow-up. Materials and Methods Sample and Design This is a prospective, longitudinal cohort study of adults admitted to the Neuro-ICU and their family caregivers at a large tertiary medical center in Boston, MA, between 2015 and 2016. The study was approved by the local institutional review board, and informed consent was obtained from all participants enrolled in the study. The full recruitment and enrollment protocol has been previously described . The inclusion criteria for patients Meyers et al. Page 3 Neurocrit Care. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2025 May 06. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript were as follows: (1) adults aged 18 years or older, (2) English fluency and literacy, and (3) hospitalization to the Neuro-ICU within the past 2 weeks. Most patients were enrolled within 2 days of Neuro-ICU admission. Patients were excluded if they were deemed unable to provide consent due to cognitive impairment; had severe aphasia or cognitive impairment that prohibited full participation; had anticipated death; or did not have an family caregiver. Patients with cognitive impairments but who were still able to fill out questionnaires with assistance were included. Patients with transient aphasia or delirium who were asymptomatic at the time of consent were considered medically able to participate. Based on historic records from our Neuro-ICU, 70% of all admitted patients would be eligible for participation. All eligible patients were cleared for participation by the ICU team. Family caregivers were eligible to participate if they met the following criteria: (1) adults aged 18 years or older, (2) English fluency and literacy, and (3) identification as a primary family caregiver for an eligible patient. As per criterion #3, only one caregiver who identified as the “primary family caregiver” was eligible for inclusion. Patients and caregivers who consented to participation completed self-report measures on demographic information, psychosocial resilience, and psychiatric symptoms at the time of enrollment. At 3- and 6-month post-discharge, dyads were contacted via email to complete follow-up psychosocial measures using REDCap, a secure online data capture software . Measures Patient and Caregiver Demographics—During enrollment, patients and caregivers reported age, sex, ethnicity, race, marital status, education, employment status, and relationship to each other. Data were collected on admission diagnosis, need for intubation during hospital stay, and discharge location. Anxiety Symptoms—Anxiety symptoms were measured via the anxiety subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-A) , a widely used and reliable measure among medical populations . Patients reported the frequency of anxiety symptoms during the past week on a scale from 0 (“Not at all”) to 3 (“Very much” or “Most of the time”). Seven items on the anxiety subscale are then summed (range 0–21), with higher scores representing greater anxiety symptoms. In our analysis, we considered scores ≥ 8 to be clinically significant mild, moderate, and severe anxiety symptoms  and used the higher cut-off of ≥ 11 to characterize clinically significant moderate or severe anxiety symptoms. Anxiety symptoms were measured during Neuro-ICU admission and at 3- and 6-month follow-up. Resiliency Factors Mindfulness: The extent to which individuals apply general concepts of mindfulness was measured via the Cognitive Affective Mindfulness Scale-Revised (CAMS-R) . The scale’s 12 items asking about engagement in mindfulness are scored on a scale from 1 (“rarely” or “not at all”) to 4 (“almost” or “always”). Scores are then summed (range 12–48), with higher scores representing greater utilization of mindfulness techniques. The Meyers et al. Page 4 Neurocrit Care. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2025 May 06. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript CAMS-R is a reliable and valid scale that has been used in prior studies in neurocritical care populations , as well as with other medical populations of patients and caregivers  It was administered during Neuro-ICU admission. Coping: Coping skills were measured via the Measure of Current Status-Part A (MOCS-A) , in which 13 items assess confidence in skills related to relaxation and behavioral and cognitive responses to stressful thoughts or situations. Items are scored on a scale from 0 (“I cannot do this at all”) to 4 (“I can do this extremely well”). The items are summed (range 0–52), and higher scores suggest better utilization of coping skills. The MOCS-A is a reliable and valid scale that has been used in prior studies in neurocritical care populations  as well as with other medical populations of patients and caregivers . It was administered during Neuro-ICU admission. Statistical Analysis We summarized participant characteristics with measures of central tendency (e.g., proportion, mean). Univariate tests (Pearson r, Chi-square, and paired sample t tests) between patient and caregiver variables were used as appropriate. Two-tailed tests were used to utilize to more conservatively identify statistical differences between participant characteristics. Statistical significance was determined with two-tailed tests and an -level of 0.05. Effect size was determined to be small, medium, or large based on Pearson r values of 0.10, 0.30, and 0.50 . We used actor–partner interdependence modeling (APIM) to test impact of resilience and anxiety symptoms on individuals and their partners . This analysis models the contribution of one dyad member’s predictors on his/her own outcome and simultaneously on his/her partner’s outcome, while accounting for the correlation between dyad members’ data. In the current study, an “actor effect” refers to the relationship between a person’s baseline measures (resiliency factors and anxiety) with his/her own anxiety symptoms at follow-up. A “partner effect” refers to the relationship between a person’s baseline measures (resiliency factors and anxiety) and his/her “partner’s” (i.e., the other dyad member’s) anxiety symptoms at follow-up. Contrast tests were used to determine whether patient and caregiver actor and partner effects were equivalent. If contrast tests yielded p < 0.05, patient and caregiver effects were considered significantly different and were interpreted separately. If contrast tests yielded p > 0.05, patient and caregiver effects were considered not significantly different and a pooled effect was interpreted. In following recommendations from the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute , we used multiple imputations with fully conditional specification to account for uncompleted measures  and created 40 imputed datasets. All analyses were performed using SPSS Version 24 . Results Participant Characteristics Our prospective cohort consisted of 114 patient–caregiver dyads. Of these, 102 patients (89%) and 103 caregivers (90%) completed study measures and were included in the Meyers et al. Page 5 Neurocrit Care. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2025 May 06. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript present analysis. Excluded individuals signed informed consent but did not complete study measures. The included patients and caregivers are from 108 unique dyads, with 96 complete patient–caregiver dyads (i.e., completed study measures by both the patient and caregiver), six patients without caregivers, and six caregivers without patients represented. Rates of psychosocial measure completion were 94% at baseline, 77% at 3 months, and 71% at 6 months. Table 1 summarizes demographic and medical characteristics. Both patients and caregivers were on average middle aged. The majority were white and completed some college education. There was a higher proportion of females to males and married/cohabitating individuals among the caregivers compared to patients. Cerebrovascular diseases, including ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, were the most common neurological diagnoses, followed by intracranial tumors or other structural lesions. The most common patient–caregiver relationship was spouse/partners. Intubation was used as a proxy for disease severity. Seventy-six percent of patients were intubated at any point during their hospitalization; 22% of patients were intubated for a reason other than surgery. Indications for intubation included status epilepticus, neurological worsening leading to altered mental status, myasthenia gravis exacerbation, and hypercarbic respiratory failure unrelated to neurological injury. Resiliency Factors and Anxiety Symptoms Patient and caregiver resiliency factors and anxiety symptom severity are summarized in Table 2. There were no differences in mindfulness and coping scores between patients and caregivers (t(1377) = −0.79 and t (653) = −0.27, respectively, p > 0.42). Rates of clinically significant moderate or severe anxiety symptoms were high and were similar for patients and caregivers at baseline (χ2 (1) = 0.6, p = 0.49). At 3- and 6-month follow-up, rates of clinically significant symptoms in patients slightly increased, while rates in caregivers slightly decreased. Overall, patients were more likely than caregivers to report moderate to severe anxiety symptoms at 3-month (χ2(1) = 9.01, p < 0.001) and 6-month follow-up (χ2 (1) = 9.82, p = 0.002). Mean HADS-A score did not differ based on sex, age, race (white vs non-white), ethnicity (Hispanic vs. non-Hispanic), marital status, or education level (all ps > 0.09). There was no difference in mean HADS-A scores between patients with vascular, structural, or other types of diagnoses (ps > 0.06), between patients who were intubated and patients who were not intubated (ps > 0.1), and between family caregivers of intubated patients and non-intubated patients (ps > 0.2). Individuals with a self-reported prior mental health history had greater HADS-A scores (M = 10.17) than those without (M = 6.62; t = −3.04, p = 0.002) at baseline and at 6 months (M = 8.99 vs. M = 6.01; t = −1.99, p = 0.047). Effects of Own Psychological Factors on Own Anxiety Symptoms (Actor Effects) Bivariate Analysis—Bivariate correlations between resilience scores and anxiety symptoms are presented in Table 3. Within individuals, baseline anxiety symptoms were positively associated with symptoms at 3- and 6-month follow-up (ps < 0.001), and mindfulness and coping scores were negatively associated with severity of anxiety symptoms at both follow-up points (ps < 0.05). Effect sizes were mainly medium to large (r > 0.3) in both patients and caregivers. Meyers et al. Page 6 Neurocrit Care. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2025 May 06. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Dyadic Analysis—Actor effects from APIM are presented in Table 4. For both patients and caregivers, severity of anxiety symptoms predicted the degree of symptoms at the subsequent time point (i.e., baseline to 3 months, 3 months to 6 months; ps < 0.001). The impact of baseline anxiety symptoms on symptoms at 3 months was greater in caregivers than patients (β = 0.732 and β = 0.471, respectively). Mindfulness and coping skills at baseline were associated with less severe anxiety symptoms at all time points. Effects of Own Psychological Factors on Partner’s Anxiety Symptoms (Partner Effects) Bivariate Analysis—Bivariate correlations between patient and caregiver factors are presented in Table 3. Patient and caregiver anxiety symptoms were positively correlated at 3- and 6-month follow-up (ps < 0.04). Patient mindfulness was negatively correlated with caregiver anxiety at 3 months (p < 0.001). One’s own coping skills were not correlated with one’s partner’s anxiety at any time point. Dyadic Analysis—Partner effects from APIM are presented in Table 4. For both patients and caregivers, an individual’s baseline mindfulness was associated with their partner’s 3-month anxiety symptom severity (p = 0.008). No other partner effects were significant. Full details on APIM are presented in Fig. 1. Discussion In our cohort of Neuro-ICU patients and their family caregivers, initial rates of anxiety were high, with 40% of patients and 42% of caregivers endorsing clinically significant symptoms at the time of the patient’s admission to the Neuro-ICU. Moderate to severe anxiety symptoms were present in 20% of patients and 23% of caregivers. These high rates of clinically significant symptoms remained relatively stable for patients and decreased slightly for caregivers. At 6 months after hospitalization, one in three patients and caregivers reported clinically significant anxiety symptoms. The present findings are in line with previous cross-sectional work detailing high rates of clinically significant anxiety in the Neuro-ICU for both patients and caregivers . As hypothesized, for both patients and caregivers, an individuals’ elevated anxiety symptoms during Neuro-ICU admission were predictive of higher levels of chronic anxiety symptoms post-discharge. The chronicity of anxiety symptoms and the predictive relationship of baseline anxiety on follow-up anxiety have been observed in non-neurocritical care populations as well. In bariatric surgery patients, while preoperative depressive symptoms significantly decreased over time, preoperative anxiety symptoms remained stable through 24–36 month post-op. More so, preoperative anxiety symptoms significantly predicted 6– 12-month and 24–36-month post-operative anxiety . In survivors of acute myocardial infarction, anxiety scores at discharge and at 3-month follow-up were the sole predictors of anxiety at 18-month follow-up after adjusting for a number of demographic and lifestyle factors . While the relationship between baseline and follow-up anxiety may seem obvious, maintaining elevated levels of anxiety symptoms beyond hospitalization is not trivial; rather, it is indicative of chronic anxiety that may have serious implications for survivors’ and caregivers’ quality of life and/or functional status. Clinically, the importance of chronic anxiety cannot be understated, as it has been associated with more adverse Meyers et al. Page 7 Neurocrit Care. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2025 May 06. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events in other critical care patients . Emotional strain has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality for caregivers . As the predictive nature of baseline anxiety on follow-up anxiety may certainly not be specific to neurocritical care populations, it is important that these symptoms are monitored and addressed across ICU and hospital settings. Interestingly, baseline anxiety symptom levels were a stronger predictor of 3-month anxiety in caregivers than in patients, suggesting that caregivers’ anxiety is particularly likely to maintain if endorsed during the patient’s hospitalization. As emotional distress in caregivers can prevent them from delivering high-quality care , both dyad members may suffer if caregivers experience high levels of anxiety in the crucial early days of the recovery process. Regardless of dyad member, given the elevated risk of adverse cerebrovascular events associated with chronic anxiety , early intervention may thus be warranted to prevent further adverse events in an already vulnerable population. Patients’ and caregivers’ levels of mindfulness and adaptive coping measured at the time of the patient’s admission to the Neuro-ICU were associated with lower own anxiety symptoms—both concurrently at admission and prospectively over the 6 months following admission. These modifiable resilience factors have been tied to improved health outcomes in a number of medical populations [15–17]. In the Neuro-ICU, cross-sectional studies have demonstrated that greater mindfulness is associated with lower psychiatric symptoms in patients  and greater quality of life in their caregivers . The present findings contribute longitudinal data to this growing evidence base in this population. Elucidating the protective qualities of mindfulness and adaptive coping may be particularly important in Neuro-ICU populations, as patients often face a lengthy recovery process, with deficits persisting well beyond discharge . Psychotherapeutic interventions that bolster these resilience factors to help patients and caregivers accept the chronic often uncertain nature of their deficits and engage in adaptive coping may lead to better adjustment post-Neuro-ICU stay. Of note, the benefits of mindfulness and adaptive coping on anxiety may not be specific to neurocritical care populations. In the absence of direct comparative evidence with other disease populations, the relative protectiveness of mindfulness and adaptive coping cannot be derived from our study. We suggest continued research efforts in examining the protective nature of mindfulness and adaptive coping in other medical populations, so as to identify specific populations that benefit from these resilience factors. The dyadic modeling used in this analysis  examined how one individual’s resilience or anxiety symptoms at hospitalization can not only impact their anxiety trajectory, but also the effects these factors can have on one’s partner’s anxiety. The previous cross-sectional research using APIM to look at resilience factors and psychological distress in Neuro-ICU patient–caregiver dyads demonstrated that for both patients and caregivers, higher levels of mindfulness in one dyad member are associated with lower levels of depressive symptoms in their partner at the time of hospital admission . The present study builds upon these findings, showing that when a patient or caregiver endorsed greater mindfulness at Neuro-ICU admission, their partner reported lower anxiety symptoms 3 months later. The prospective partner effect of mindfulness on anxiety did not, however, extend to anxiety symptoms at 6 months. It is possible that heightened anxiety symptoms after 3 Meyers et al. Page 8 Neurocrit Care. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2025 May 06. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript months may be more chronic and stable. Indeed, our analysis showed that 3-month anxiety was a stronger predictor of 6-month anxiety than baseline anxiety was of anxiety at 3 months. However, a more mindful partner may still be protective long term, as lower levels of anxiety at 3 months predict less future anxiety. These findings highlight the importance of dyadic modeling in critically ill patients and their caregivers by demonstrating interdependent protective factors (i.e., mindfulness-based practices) that can be utilized in early interventions. While APIM analysis reveals partner effects while controlling for actor effects and therefore produces a conservative estimate, further work is needed to replicate these results. The present findings, in conjunction with a growing evidence on psychosocial factors in Neuro-ICU patients and caregivers , have important clinical implications. First, since those with clinically significant anxiety during the hospitalization are at high risk of developing chronic anxiety through 6 months, and mindfulness and adaptive coping at hospitalization are associated with less severe anxiety symptoms, an early intervention that starts in the hospital, continues through discharge, and teaches mindfulness-based practices and adaptive coping strategies may prevent the development of chronic anxiety in NeuroICU patients and their family caregivers. Second, since an individual’s higher mindfulness early in the hospitalization is associated with lower anxiety in their partner at 3 months, the most promising interventions are likely dyad-based (i.e., patient and caregiver together). Qualitatively, patients and caregivers confirm experiencing high anxiety in the Neuro-ICU and express interest in participating in an early dyadic intervention aimed at preventing chronic emotional distress . These findings contribute to a larger conversation taking place in the critical care literature about post-intensive care syndrome (PICS), a constellation of physical, cognitive, and psychiatric symptoms that persist after an ICU stay . While characterizing PICS in the context of the neurological sequalae experienced by Neuro-ICU patients can be challenging, and this investigation looks at only one facet of this multidimensional condition, our findings are in line with rates of anxiety previously reported in the Neuro-ICU PICS literature . Perhaps more significantly, the high rates of anxiety seen in caregivers in our study speaks to the concept of PICS-F, or the psychological ramifications of ICU hospitalization for the family members of the critically ill . The role of psychological resilience factors and their interdependence between patients and caregivers suggests a potential avenue for prevention and treatment of PICS and PICS-F. Our study is not without limitations. First, as only dyads in which patients had intact cognitive functioning were included, our findings cannot be generalized to all patient– caregiver dyads admitted to the Neuro-ICU, particularly the most severely impaired patients. Future inquiries should examine the trajectory of anxiety symptoms in caregivers of patients of worse cognitive status, after accounting for admission anxiety symptoms and resiliency factors. Next, although participants completed the self-report measures privately, there was still potential for positive response bias. Additionally, the present analysis includes limited clinical data on the patients’ hospital course, including duration of and reason for intubation. Future studies should incorporate indication for and duration of intubation. Finally, our Meyers et al. Page 9 Neurocrit Care. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2025 May 06. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript sample was predominantly white (87%), and thus, our methods should be replicated in a larger, more racially diverse sample. Conclusions Neurocritical care patients and their family caregivers experienced high rates of anxiety during admission through 6 months. The severity of individuals’ anxiety symptoms, as well as usage of mindfulness and adaptive coping strategies, was directly linked to one’s own development of chronic anxiety post-discharge. Between dyad members, mindfulness-based practices had a protectively interdependent effect on the development of anxiety at 3 months. However, this effect is not present at 6-month follow-up. Early, dyadic-based interventions that teach mindfulness and adaptive coping strategies are needed to prevent the development of chronic anxiety in neurocritical care patients without major cognitive deficits and their family caregivers.',\n",

OBJECTIVES: Severe acute brain injury (SABI) from cardiac arrest and traumatic brain injury happens suddenly and unexpectedly, carrying high potential for lifelong disability with substantial prognostic uncertainty. Comprehensive assessments of family experiences and support needs after SABI are lacking. Our objective is to elicit “on-the-ground” perspectives about the experiences and needs of families of patients with SABI. DESIGN: Two-phase qualitative study of families and multidisciplinary U.S. healthcare professionals (mHCPs) with expertise in SABI: Phase 1 included semistructured interviews to generate formative findings; phase 2 entailed facilitated discussions to confirm and expand initial findings. SETTING: Phase 1: academic medical center; phase 2: virtual workshop. SUBJECTS: Phase 1 included seven family members and 12 mHCPs. Phase 2 included nationally recruited stakeholders (17 family members and 12 mHCPs). INTERVENTION: None. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: We explored: 1) what are families’ needs in the first 48 hours? 2) How are these needs addressed? and 3) How can hospitals better meet these needs? Qualitative analysis included inductive and deductive approaches guided by a conceptual ecological model. Four major needs were identified: 1) challenges in coping with uncertainty in early prognostication, 2) inattention to physical needs of family, 3) deficits in compassionate and consistent communication, and 4) need for engagement with families as stakeholders in improving future practices. Participants’ recommendations included: 1) ways to communicate more clearly and consistently, 2) better assistance with navigating resources and access to places for families to care for themselves, and 3) opportunities for families to remain connected with their loved ones, social support networks, and the clinical team. CONCLUSIONS: Stakeholders identified novel insights regarding families’ experiences during the hospitalization of comatose SABI patients and factors that can contribute to improved decision-making and physical/emotional outcomes. Interventions to address these unmet needs are promising targets to improve outcomes.

Dickert, MD, PhD8 Robert Silbergleit, MD4 The Experiences and Needs of Families of Comatose Patients After Cardiac Arrest and Severe Neurotrauma: The Perspectives of National Key Stakeholders During a National Institutes of Health–Funded Workshop ORIGINAL CLINICAL REPORT Muehlschlegel et al 2  March 2022 • Volume 4 • Number 3 members are charged with functioning as a proxy to represent patient values and preferences while grappling with their own emotional trauma (1, 2). As research from general critical care shows, families are propelled into the role of caregiver and surrogate decision-maker, both with extreme levels of responsibility for which they are often unprepared, creating significant emotional burden as they deal with the patient’s critical illness and uncertain recovery (3–5). Interventions to support families as surrogate decision-makers exist but have failed to mitigate longterm psychologic distress (6, 7). Experts have argued that supporting families in their surrogate decision-making role alone is not enough; families require additional strategies to reduce long-term emotional effects (8). Families of patients with SABI also have unique additional stressors that limit generalizations from nonbrain injured populations. SABI is typically very sudden and unexpected, and it carries high potential for lifelong disability and substantial prognostic uncertainty during the early period of illness (9–11). Comprehensive assessments of family experiences after SABI and families’ specific needs for emotional, physical, and spiritual support are lacking. Our primary objective was to understand the experiences and needs of families of patients with SABI from the perspectives of multiple stakeholders. These findings will inform future interventions to support families after SABI, diminish psychologic distress of families struggling with the surrogate role, and guide clinicians and hospitals in providing patient- and family-centered care. We focused on the early hospitalization when emotional shock, prognostic uncertainty, and acute stress prevail. We aimed to examine: 1) the information families of SABI patients needed and received, 2) how information was communicated, and 3) families’ emotional, physical, and spiritual needs. MATERIALS AND METHODS We conducted a two-phase qualitative study of families of comatose patients hospitalized after cardiac arrest or sTBI and healthcare professionals who care for this patient population. Phase 1 was a single-site study using individual semistructured interviews to generate formative findings. Phase 2 was a virtual workshop bringing together a national purposive sample of stakeholders to further explore and expand on findings from phase 1. This combination of both phases with multiple data sources was designed to facilitate triangulation and to increase trustworthiness of the data. Participants included family members of survivors and nonsurvivors, and healthcare professionals, including emergency medicine and critical care physicians, researchers, paramedics, critical care nurses, chaplains, and social workers. The study team was assembled to include four cochairs with expertise in neuroprognostication, surrogate decision-making, and emergency research, supplemented by two methodologic experts in medical ethics and qualitative research. Five qualitative researchers from Westat, a health, statistical, and social science research organization headquartered in Rockville, MD, drafted interview and workshop discussion guides, conducted interviews, facilitated workshop discussions, and analyzed data. The Westat research team was composed of four research staff experienced in mixed methods research under the supervision of a Project Director with doctoral training in Developmental Psychology. Study procedures were supported by an administrative supplement to the “Strategies to Innovate EmeRgENcy Care Clinical Trials Network,” a clinical trials network focused upon improving the outcomes of patients with neurologic, cardiac, respiratory, and hematologic emergencies by identifying effective treatments given in the earliest stages of care. All study procedures were reviewed and deemed exempt for further review by the Westat Institutional Review Board (Date of approval: February 25, 2019). Phase 1: Family, Clinician, and Ancillary Staff Member Interviews Setting and Study Population.. We conducted oneon-one semistructured interviews with participants from a single academic medical center intentionally sampled for its experience with postcardiac arrest and sTBI care. Participants included family members of patients with cardiac arrest and sTBI, clinicians, and ancillary staff. We purposively sampled each group to ensure diversity by race/ethnicity, gender, and specialty. Given the highly sensitive nature of the research and challenges of recruiting, we asked clinicians to identify family members with whom they had existing clinical relationships. Data Collection, Management, and Analysis. The research team developed interview guides with Original Clinical Report Critical Care Explorations  3 open-ended questions (Supplementary Digital Content 1,  focusing on our three major study questions. Hour-long interviews were conducted with healthcare professional participants in July-August 2020 and with family member participants in August-October 2020. All interviews were conducted telephonically and were led by a Westat qualitative researcher. A second Westat staff member took notes and served as an observer during each interview. Interviews were audiorecorded, professionally transcribed, and imported into NVivo11 (QSR International Pty Ltd. 2017). Westat developed a codebook using both a deductive and inductive analysis approach. The initial codebook was structured around a framework that focused on families’ experiences within five domains based on an ecological model adapted from National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (12) (Fig. 1). The core concept of ecological models is that health behaviors have multiple levels of influences (social, psychologic, environmental, public policies, etc.) and are often used as frameworks for understanding these interacting factors of health behaviors (13). The codebook was then refined inductively through iterative review of the data and sharing of emerging thematic content among the coders. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus. Phase 2: Virtual Workshop We conducted a virtual workshop on November 19, 2020, to confirm the initial findings from families and providers with multiple stakeholders, capture missing themes, and expand upon themes identified during phase 1. Setting and Study Population. The cochairs identified 30 invitees from across the United States: 18 family members and 12 healthcare professionals. We created a purposeful sample of U.S. healthcare professionals based on their known expertise in the care of patients with SABI, and their engagement in research focused on families of SABI patients. We chose family member participants to maximize representation by gender, race, and patient’s disease and survival status among family participants. Family members were identified by study cochairs, healthcare professionals who were recruited as participants, and a national organization with a survivor/caregiver network (Sudden Cardiac Arrest Foundation, Wexford, PA,  We used snowball sampling to further identify family participants from these initial individuals. We offered technological support and compensated them $500 for their time. Workshop Agenda. The workshop was conducted virtually using Zoom for Government. Four trained qualitative researchers from Westat facilitated discussions according to a predetermined agenda (Supplementary Digital Content 2,  com/CCX/A939). Presentations and Reflection Sessions After a presentation of the phase 1 findings, attendees were divided into four groups (two groups of families and two groups of healthcare professionals) to reflect, each guided by a Westat facilitator and Ins\\x1ftu\\x1fonal (ED and ICU) Hospital Staﬀ FAMILY MEMBERS SOCIOCULTURAL INFORMATION COMMUNICATION PHYSICAL EMOTIONAL Figure 1. Analytical framework. We applied a framework, grouping family members’ experiences into five domains based on an ecological model adapted from the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities where there are multiple and bidirectional interactions among the domains and levels of influence (12). The five domains included: information (verbal or written information about the patient’s status or care and navigating the hospital), communication (how this information is conveyed to the family member), emotional (range of emotional needs), sociocultural (how cultural, religious, and social beliefs affect family members’ experiences), and physical (how the hospital physical environment can be better suited for family members). ED = emergency department. Muehlschlegel et al 4  March 2022 • Volume 4 • Number 3 workshop cochair. A discussion guide was used to substantiate findings and identify gaps of the phase 1 findings (Supplementary Digital Content 3,  lww.com/CCX/A939). Breakout Sessions Two rounds of breakout sessions were conducted. During the first session, the two family groups discussed their perceptions on logistical needs in the first 48 hours, and two healthcare professional groups focused on “provider training” and “care as a team” approaches. The second breakout session included four mixed groups of families and healthcare professionals to solicit diverse perspectives on “communication of uncertainty” in the first 48 hours. Data Management and Analysis. All workshop sessions were recorded and professionally transcribed. Additional data sources included Padlet responses (Padlet by Wallwisher, San Francisco, CA]), chat messages, notes and observations from research staff, and postworkshop e-mails. Westat analyzed these data using the analytic framework from phase 1 while focusing on our main research questions. The analysts looked for any disconfirming findings, expanded understandings, and confirmation from the previous findings. Triangulation of Findings From Phase 1. Data were analyzed to produce summative themes related to family members’ needs and categorized according to domains within the research framework. We also assembled strategies used by hospital staff and institutions or recommended by families to address these needs. We considered findings transferable if they were generated in phase 1 and supported in phase 2. We added new themes or subthemes that emerged from the workshop to the overarching analytic framework. RESULTS In phase 1, 19 participants were interviewed (seven family members and 12 healthcare professionals). In phase 2, of 30 individuals invited, 29 participated in the workshop (17 family members and 12 healthcare professionals). Table 1 displays the participant characteristics. We categorized findings by domains according to the analytical framework (Fig. 1). Although the intent was to examine the first 48 hours of the patient’s admission, many family members discussed needs beyond this time period. Representative quotes for all domains are shown in Table 2. Complete domains from both phases are shown in Supplementary Digital Contents 4–8 ( Domain 1: Information Needs Family members reported a need for information about their loved one’s (LO’s) disease progression and possible outcomes, especially if the injury or condition may be fatal or seriously impact quality of life. Family members also expressed a need for information about their LO’s care plans and test results and expressed frustration when updates were not received in a timely manner. They expressed logistical concerns related to contacting the care team. To support informed decision-making, families commented on the importance of receiving clear information about options, including therapies and treatments. Families discussed that they clarified their understanding through trusted and knowledgeable resources (friends, family, or established physician relationships). Many participants discussed their reliance on personal contacts in the medical field to help them make decisions. Searching the internet was described as “overwhelming” for families. Finally, families discussed their need for hospital staff to share information about what to expect in transitions from the emergency department (ED) to ICU, as well as to different postdischarge care settings. Healthcare professionals in both phases of the research discussed the physicians’ responsibility to communicate uncertainty honestly to families without declaring premature conclusions, which can have deleterious effects on patient outcomes (i.e., a self-fulfilling prophecy). They noted variation across physicians in communicating uncertainty. Domain 2: Communication Needs Families emphasized the need for healthcare professionals to be clear, consistent, and compassionate in their communication, particularly when delivering bad news. They often recalled feeling overcome with emotion and distracted and appreciated when healthcare professionals’ communication facilitated information processing. Families identified practices such as repeating information, pausing for families to ask questions, and avoiding medical terminology or clarifying Original Clinical Report Critical Care Explorations  5 TABLE 1.

Representative Quotes by Analysis Domain Domain Representative Participant Quotes Information “I do remember feeling like frustrated or a little just – like the fear of the unknown. Like first they were talking about like on day one they were talking about like being in a coma, and like nobody ever said to me like your [loved one is] in a coma or – I mean, I could see that she wasn’t awake, but I don’t know, just to hear those words was hard, and then the next day they’re talking about a TBI. … but like nobody ever said to me she has a traumatic brain injury. And I’ll tell you, that hit me the hardest.” (family member [FM], Phase 1) “I think things should be forthright and the person like me who is waiting for this stuff, especially if they have a major test like that, a CT scan, MRI, when you have those kinds of things, you should be informed on what’s going on with them.” (FM, Phase 1) “So much scary info online, so need to direct us to trustworthy sites/sources vs. looking up info on our own...” (FM, Phase 2—Padlet) “I don’t think everyone does it well, but I can tell you what we try to teach and preach, which is just—In a way embracing uncertainty… So it can be uncomfortable. But I think we do a disservice to our patients when we don’t acknowledge uncertainty.” (Professional, Phase 2) Communication needs “They’d answer and explain things in, you know, terminology that we could all understand, and never made us feel rushed. We could ask whatever questions we wanted. They gave us their business cards. So, I think they were a source of comfort and you know, just trying to answer our questions and reassure us about things.” (FM, Phase 1) “We did not have a social worker greet us. We did not have a single point of contact…never met the neurologist, and I hope I don’t offend anybody by saying this, but I felt like they were on two different planets, the cardiologist and the neurologist.” (FM, Phase 2) “One of the principal problems in all of this is that modern medicine is shift work, and you don’t have the same provider from start to finish. And that’s true at the nursing level, just as much as that is true at the physician level with very rare exceptions. And that becomes a problem.” (Professional, Phase 2) Emotional needs “Just the thought of not knowing, and not know if he’s dying, is he going to be okay. You know, I didn’t know. So, I just prayed about it, and I didn’t know what else to do.” (FM, Phase 1) “But I think I’d be disingenuous if I said we just have absolutely no idea, because that’s not really discussing and preparing the family for the situation in which – what you’re facing...having done this for a very long time, I’m coming from a place where I’ve been disappointed at the level of certainty that physicians have had when they’re wrong over time. And that’s been the biggest concern that I’ve seen over my 25-year career as a neuro intensivist, is that physicians have overestimated their ability to precisely prognosticate poor outcomes early after injury.” (Professional, Phase 2) Sociocultural needs “And when I tell you I was treated so nasty, and when I tell you that my son was treated so nasty, (cries) and when I tell you I tried to stay respectful, I didn’t say anything out of line to nobody and I just let it pass. And I’m not the one to let nothing pass when somebody’s being disrespectful. And you know, I’m glad I’m here to tell my side of the story. I don’t know if it’s my background, I don’t know what it is, but like I said, I have a bunch of professional kids in my family – when we came in there, we were quiet, we kept everything clean. I had to ask for mop buckets for my son’s room. I had to ask for – for a sheet, because we had to wash my son up. We had to wipe his butt. We had to suction out his neck and clean his nose out. When I tell you that I was disrespected on every level, I’m honest. I was. But that’s okay, though. That’s okay. We prevailed. (FM, Phase 2) “Thank you, guys, so much, was so glad to share that, never got to share. kind of suppressed it, was glad to let out because I know there’s others that will no doubt go thru” (FM, Phase 2– Chat). “[It is] important [for healthcare professionals] to establish relationships and understand patient values” (Professional, Phase 2– Padlet). Physical needs “I was met at the door by a clergyman who took me into a little room which kind of scared me, because I knew that that meant things were really bad, but it was a space that I could just be isolated from other places. And he stayed with me the whole time. And then there’s a whole compassionate care team at the hospital, and the first thing they did (laughs) was give me this blanket that was knitted by Women In Prayer, which I cherish, and I’ve taken to the hospital any time [name] had to go back.” (FM, Phase 2) “So I do think that people get very lost in hospitals. [They] can be very confused about where they’re going to go, and unfortunately while providers, physicians, nurses are prioritizing the patient’s health, families are often literally lost, and don’t know what to do.” (Professional, Phase 2) Original Clinical Report Critical Care Explorations  7 frequently used terms, such as “TBI” and “coma,” as helpful. Families recalled confusion over roles and responsibilities of healthcare team members, leaving them unsure of what type of information to request from individuals at the bedside or whom to ask to speak to. Families emphasized the importance of receiving consistent information from healthcare professionals, particularly when consultants were involved. Some families experienced consulting clinicians communicating in “siloes,” indicating a perceived lack of coordination with the primary team. A holistic team functioning collectively, in communication with one another, provides more consistent information to families. Healthcare professionals confirmed the importance of communicating with compassion to families and emphasized the importance of spending time with families to build trust. One healthcare professional reflected on the challenges of shift work and the potential for the impression of “disjointed” care teams. Domain 3: Emotional Needs Families experienced a range of feelings (shock, distress, confusion, and despair) as they attempted to cope with their LOs’ critical illness. The unexpected life-threatening event, uncertainty regarding their LO’s outcome, and reliance on the healthcare team for compassionate support contributed to their emotional responses. It was important to families that the healthcare team genuinely cared for their LOs. They valued the care team frequently “checking-in” with updates, being respectful and attentive, addressing questions, and conveying empathy and compassion. Social support from friends and family, as well as services offered at the hospital, helped families deal with their emotional overload. Regarding prognostication, most families generally desired explicit information on what to anticipate, but some expressed difficulty hearing about a possible poor prognosis. A few stated that they wished to hear the range of possible outcomes, given the reality of prognostic uncertainty and a desire to prepare for the worst, whereas others preferred this information to remain hopeful. Several indicated that they were unaware that death or poor quality of life were potential outcomes. Conversely, physicians were more likely to express concern about providing inaccurate information. Physicians also discussed the challenge of overconfident colleagues when conveying prognosis. Domain 4: Sociocultural Needs During both study phases, families and healthcare professionals emphasized the need for equitable treatment and socioculturally appropriate communication to ensure that families feel respected and are treated without bias. Participants noted that these vital factors contribute to effective and positive communication and encourage rapport building between the families and the care team. During the workshop in particular, one family described negative experiences, such as discriminatory care due to the family’s race. For instance, some families felt disregarded, overlooked, and even disrespected by some hospital staff whom they perceived as racist. These families expressed hope that sharing their experiences could improve how other families are cared for and stressed the importance of providing families an opportunity to reflect on their experiences. Domain 5: Physical Needs Families described needs related to physical, tangible, or logistical issues, including the location and hours of the cafeteria, visitor parking locations, and lodging. Several families desired a comfortable private space within the hospital. The physical needs changed over the first 48 hours, especially for those who had to travel emergently to be at their LO’s bedside. Families described being so focused on the status of their LO that many arrived at the hospital without remembering to bring personal belongings and other travel items for a stay of unknown duration. They wanted visitation rules that allowed families to be with their LO aroundthe-clock and to be allowed to assist in cleaning and bathing the patient as a way to connect with their LO. Cross-Cutting Themes Consistent themes related to family experience emerged from both phases and cut across all domains: 1) a desire for information about illness and prognosis for recovery and the challenges of uncertainty, 2) identifying gaps in provision of logistical information and support, 3) importance of communicating compassion, sharing uncertainty, and responding to emotional and Muehlschlegel et al 8  March 2022 • Volume 4 • Number 3 physical needs, and 4) a desire to participate in the discussion and development of practices to improve support for future families in similar situations. Key Recommendations for Hospitals and Staff Workshop participants identified a number of strategies to address the various needs of family members during the first 48 hours (Table 3). Three areas of focus identified by families included: 1) clear, compassionate, and timely information about the patient’s status, expectations, and care, 2) to feel respected and part of their LO’s care team, and 3) various types of support after their LO is discharged from the hospital or dies. Recommendations for actions hospital staff and institutions can do to alleviate these major concerns were discussed by the group and detailed in Table 3. DISCUSSION In this qualitative study, we elicited real-world, “onthe-ground” perspectives of families, multidisciplinary clinical providers, advocates, and experienced researchers. This approach bringing multiple stakeholders together presents novel insights regarding emergency and critical care in SABI. Our findings address the call to better understand families’ experiences in SABI and to illuminate factors that contribute quality of decision-making and long-term patient and family physical and emotional outcomes (9, 14, 15). Our findings underscore the need to include families in discussions on how to improve care for SABI patients and emphasize the need for institutional support to the entire family unit. Our study confirms and extends prior findings from sTBI (9) but also provides recommendations formulated by key stakeholders to enhance the care of families in their times of crisis. Implementation of these recommendations could improve family experience and also help healthcare providers, who experience the stress of caring for critically ill patients and families on the worst day of their lives. By design, our study contrasted the perceptions and needs of families with the experience of healthcare providers. Families repeatedly emphasized the need for direct, timely, and consistent information from clinicians that is presented empathically. Although the need to “communicate uncertainty with directness” was mentioned by families, it did not rise to the top of their needs. However, especially among physicians, the topic of communicating uncertainty around neuroprognostication was a repeated focus of discussion. The source of this discordance may stem from physicians’ reluctance to disclose uncertainty and their perception that discussing prognostic uncertainty with families is “harmful” (10, 16–19). Concomitantly, physicians raised concern that families do not understand uncertainty. Previous research on family perspectives about uncertainty is mixed. One study indicates a lack of awareness among families of prognostic uncertainty (20), whereas other studies in both general critical care and sTBI have found that families are quite aware of prognostic uncertainty, finding it “unavoidable” and “inherently present” (10, 16). Our findings suggest that physicians should focus on clear and honest communication, including directly acknowledging and stating that uncertainty exists. One notable observation in our study was the willingness of families to collaborate and use their experiences to improve care for others. Such patient and family partnerships have had positive impact on clinical care and prioritization of research questions, while being highly valued by the patients, families, and many participating clinicians (9, 14, 21). Similarly, in our study, stakeholders illuminated blind spots within systems of care, for example, the need for care teams to communicate with each other to provide uniform information to families. The clinicians participating in our study endorsed the value of families’ experiences and embraced the opportunity to improve patient- and family-centered care. Our study has notable strengths and limitations. We conducted an in-depth phase within a single setting first, followed by a phase with a broad geographic representation. Cardiac arrest and sTBI are common and emblematic diseases among SABI; therefore, our findings are likely transferable to other catastrophic neurologic emergencies. Additionally, the workshop afforded a unique opportunity to bring families and healthcare providers into a shared discussion and to engage in dialogue raising awareness of the need to improve support for families. Despite extensive efforts to enroll participants diverse in gender, race, and roles, the family participants were predominantly highly educated, non-Hispanic White women. Our challenging experience recruiting minority participants is not unique (9, 22). One Original Clinical Report Critical Care Explorations  9 TABLE 3.

Palliative care training for physicians with best practices for the conduct of family meetings Establish communication competencies for providers and offer trainings on multiple topics, including empathetic communication, recognizing family distress, and providing comfort Family Need Recommendations To feel respected and part of their loved one’s care team Hospital Staff Can Spend time with family members to build trust, assess communication needs, and build rapport Pay attention to how family members respond when engaging with them and recognize different styles, values, beliefs, and communication needs Deliver news in a human and empathetic way, with sincerity and authenticity Give guidance for how best to interact with their loved one and encourage involvement in their loved one’s care and care team discussions Encourage additional family and community members to provide support for the patient and family Institutions Can Promote family- and patient-centered care Implement quality improvement strategies, such as recording family meetings to provide feedback on providers’ communication and promote a culture of continuous learning in communication Provide training and mentoring for providers to understand how sociocultural background affects trust, communication, and healthcare decisions; and how racial inequities affect health Family Need Recommendations Various types of support after their loved one is discharged from the hospital or dies Hospital Staff Can Explain how hospital staff can support transitions (e.g., roles and responsibilities of social workers) and how to access information about resources and support options after discharge Provide information to ease the transition post-emergency department/ICU, including accessing disability benefits, what to expect in behavioral or personality changes, whom to call with questions, and rehabilitation Assist families of nonsurvivors with arrangements, such as funeral planning and autopsy Institutions Can Develop a continuity of care procedure for postdischarge support and share opportunities with family Assess how staff can support transitions Consider opportunities for families and the care team to reunite to share gratitude and experience Muehlschlegel et al 10  March 2022 • Volume 4 • Number 3 participating Black family’s experience with racism and unacceptable treatment during their family member’s hospitalization provides context for how such negative interactions can erode minority families’ trust in the healthcare system and willingness to engage in medical research. Tailored and innovative approaches are needed to explore more fully how racism influences family members’ experiences. Additionally, we experienced challenges in enrolling families of nonsurvivors during the hospitalization, presumably due to the aversion of reexperiencing the traumas associated with the event or resentfulness with the outcome. Future research should explore the relationship between families’ information and decision-making needs, health outcomes, and cost. Finally, researchers need to develop and study efficacy of interventions to support family members’ informational and decision-making needs through means such as family support tools (23) or decision aids that facilitate shared decision-making (24–26). CONCLUSIONS In this two-phase study, we identified and confirmed major needs of families of patients with SABI after cardiac arrest and sTBI. Key stakeholders’ perspectives informed recommendations on how to better support families during the acute phase of hospitalization. Our study underscores the need to include families in discussions on how to optimally tailor care for patients with SABI. 1 Departments of Neurology, Anesthesiology/Critical Care & Surgery, University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School, Worcester, MA. 2 Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Colorado, Denver, CO. 3 Department of Emergency Medicine, Critical Care Medicine & Neurology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA. 4 Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI. 5 Westat, Rockville, MD. 6 Department of Public Health Sciences, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC. 7 Mixed Methods Program and Department of Family Medicine, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI. 8 Department of Medicine (Div.

       " 'Introduction Admission to the neurological intensive care unit (neuro-ICU) is often an unexpected and traumatic event for both patients and their informal caregivers (i.e. family and/or friends who provide instrumental and emotional support (1) and many develop clinically significant posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms during the hospitalization (patients: 21% informal caregivers: 17%) (2,3). These rates are particularly alarming, as elevated PTSD symptoms have been linked to increased risk of mortality in other critically ill populations (4). Quality of life (QoL) is an individual’s perceived position in life relative to their values, goals, standards, and expectations (5). QoL is an important outcome for both neurocritical care patients, who have to adjust to potential cognitive, emotional, and physical health consequences of their acute brain injury, and caregivers who must juggle their own life responsibilities with the sudden challenges that accompany their loved one’s condition (e.g. role changing, uncertainty of loved one’s prognosis, alteration of future plans, etc.) (6). Previous research has shown that the cognitive and physical effects of the acute neurological injury are not enough to explain the poor QoL experienced by patients and caregivers (7,8). PTSD symptoms experienced during hospitalization may be implicated in poor quality of life in both neurocritical care patients and caregivers, though these relationships have yet to be adequately explored. In survivors of various acute cerebrovascular accidents, recent research has uncovered that PTSD symptoms are cross-sectionally and prospectively associated with lower QoL and greater physical disability (9–12). In caregivers, a prior cross-sectional study by Zale et al (13) found that greater caregiver anxiety and depression scores were associated with worse physical, psychological, and social QoL during the Presciutti et al. Page 2 Neurocrit Care. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 February 01. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript patient’s neuro-ICU admission. Although this study did not examine PTSD symptoms specifically, it does highlight the importance of psychological symptoms when considering QoL in caregivers of neuro-ICU patients. Further study is needed to understand the role of early PTSD in future QoL of both patients and caregivers. Prior work has shown that PTSD symptom presentations are quite heterogenous (14). As such, recent efforts have started to examine correlates of PTSD symptom clusters or dimensions (4,15–18) in order to inform the development of targeted interventions. The 4factor numbing model of PTSD symptom dimensions for intrusive re-experiencing, effortful avoidance, emotional numbing, and hyperarousal, and has an established evidence base for its characterization of PTSD symptoms (19,20), including PTSD in a neurologically compromised cohort of cardiac arrest survivors (17). Importantly, however, potential correlates of these PTSD symptoms, such as QoL, have yet to be examined. Thus, identifying the specific lower-order PTSD dimensions associated with future impairments in QoL is an important first step in developing targeted interventions to improve QoL for neurocritical care patients and caregivers. Illness in the neuro-ICU can be quite heterogeneous, and the limitations that neurological disease impose complicate psychological research methods in neuro-ICU populations. As such, the present study pilot tested the feasibility of assessing PTSD symptoms experienced in the neuro-ICU and their relationship with QoL in both patients and caregivers. We first examined the prospective association of total PTSD symptoms with domains of QoL among both neurocritical care patients and caregivers. Our primary hypothesis was that higher PTSD symptom scores at hospitalization would predict lower QoL scores 3 months later, for both patients and caregivers. Secondary analysis explored differential associations between specific PTSD symptom dimensions (as characterized by 4-factor numbing model) and QoL domains, for both patients and caregivers. Methods Sample and Design The present study is a subgroup analysis within a larger prospective, longitudinal, cohort study of dyads of patients and caregivers of patients admitted to the neuro-ICU at a large, tertiary, academic medical center in Boston, MA. Data collection took place between 2015– 2016 and was approved by the local institutional review board. The full recruitment and enrollment protocol has been described previously (2). Briefly, inclusion criteria for patients were as follows: 1) aged 18 years or older, 2) exhibited English fluency and literacy, and 3) hospitalized to the Neuro-ICU within the previous 2-weeks. Patients were excluded if they were deemed unable to provide consent due to cognitive impairment, had severe aphasia or cognitive impairment that prohibited full participation, had permanent cognitive impairment, anticipated death, or did not have an informal caregiver. Patients with transient aphasia or mild cognitive symptoms who were oriented and communicative at the time of consent were considered medically able to participate. All eligible patients were cleared for participation by the medical team. Informal caregivers were eligible to participate if they met the following criteria: 1) aged 18 years or older, 2) Presciutti et al. Page 3 Neurocrit Care. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 February 01. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript exhibited English fluency and literacy, and 3) were identified as a primary informal caregiver for an eligible patient. As per criterion #3, only the caregiver who identified as the “primary caregiver” was eligible for inclusion, and only caregivers of patients who achieved neurological normalization were included. Patients and caregivers who consented to participation completed self-report measures of demographic information and psychiatric symptoms at the time of enrollment (i.e. within the first 2-weeks of neuro-ICU admission). At 3-months post-discharge, patients and caregivers were contacted via email to complete follow-up QoL measures using REDCap, a secure online data capture software (21). The analytic sample for the current study included data from 70 patients and 64 caregivers (see Figure 1 for flow chart); the data were not paired and thus two different datasets were used for analysis. Measures Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms in Response to Neuro-ICU Admission—PTSD symptoms was measured via the PTSD Checklist-Specific (PCL-S) (22) to assess symptom severity for all 17 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) symptoms for PTSD (23) during neuro-ICU admission. Patients and caregivers rated the degree to which they experienced each symptom in the past month, with reference to “being admitted to the ICU” or “being a loved one of a patient admitted to the ICU” on a scale from 1 (“Not at all”) to 5 (“Extremely”). The PCL-S has demonstrated acceptable test-retest reliability (24) and has shown to be excellently sensitive and specific for identifying PTSD clinical diagnosis (25). For our primary analysis, we calculated total scaled scores from the PCL-S, which was then treated a continuous predictor. For our secondary analysis, we created four continuous variables from total scaled scores for each PTSD symptom dimension in the 4-factor numbing model of PTSD (i.e. reexperiencing, avoidance, numbing, hyperarousal). Because the four dimensions did not have the same scaled score ranges, we converted the total scaled scores to z-scores. Table 1 presents the allocation of each PCL-S item on respective symptom dimensions. Quality of Life—Four domains of QoL were measured via the World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF) (5). The WHOQOL-BREF is widely used as a patient reported outcome measure for perceived quality of life across four domains (physical, psychological, social, and environmental QoL). The physical QoL subscale assesses perceived independence in activities of daily living, use of medical treatments, pain, mobility, sleep, fatigue, and work capacity. The psychological QoL subscale assesses experience of both positive and negative emotions, cognitive function, self-esteem, meaning making, and body image. The social QoL subscale examines satisfaction with and availability of social support, and satisfaction with sex life. The environmental QoL subscale examines perceptions of one’s physical environment and availability of resources (e.g. safety and security, opportunities for recreation, transportation). Individual items are rated on a 5point scale, with higher scores indicating greater QoL. Domain scores were calculated from respective subscales according to published scoring recommendations (range 4−20) (26). Presciutti et al. Page 4 Neurocrit Care. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 February 01. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Patient Clinical Variables—Patient medical and treatment variables were obtained from their electronic medical record, including diagnosis and whether the patient was intubated during their hospitalization. Because a large portion of our patients were diagnosed with a stroke or hemorrhage, we dichotomized patient diagnosis into either having a stroke/ hemorrhage or having another diagnosis. Patient intubation was used as a proxy for disease severity. It should be noted, however, that intubation on its own is an inexact marker of disease severity; further intubation details such as reasons for intubation and length of intubation are presented in Table 2. Statistical Analysis Plan—We ran Fisher’s Exact and Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests as appropriate to examine differences between patients and caregivers’ demographic variables, patients’ medical variables, total scaled PTSD symptom scores, total scaled PTSD symptom dimension scores, and QoL domain calculated scores. Next, we ran two bivariate correlation matrices between PTSD symptom dimension scores amongst patients and caregivers. We then conducted separate, identical statistical analyses for patients and caregivers, as these data were not paired. For our primary analysis, we ran a multiple linear regression model for each QoL domain, with total PTSD symptom severity entered as the predictor, adjusted for sex, age, race (white), patient diagnosis (stroke/hemorrhage), and intubation status. Covariate selection was based on potential confounders of QoL in neuro-ICU populations as identified in the literature (9,27). For our secondary, exploratory, analysis, to examine the unique effect of PTSD symptom dimensions on QoL, we ran a linear regression model for each QoL domain, with all four zscored PTSD symptom dimensions entered as predictors, adjusted for age and sex. Given our sample size (patients n = 70; caregivers n = 64), only two demographic variables (age and sex) were chosen as covariates so as to not overfit the models. All analyses were completed using SPSS Version 25 (28). Results Participant Characteristics Patient and caregiver characteristics can be found in Table 2. There were no significant differences between patients and caregivers in terms of demographics, total PTSD symptom severity, PTSD symptom dimension scaled scores, or QoL domain scores. Correlations between PTSD Symptom Dimensions Bivariate correlation matrices are presented in Table 3. All PTSD symptom dimensions were moderately-strongly correlated amongst patients (r = .65–.79, p < .001) and caregivers (r = .55–.78, p < .001). Associations of Total PTSD Symptom Severity on Quality of Life Domains Full details on the association between total PTSD symptom severity with QoL in patients and caregivers are presented in Table 4. Presciutti et al. Page 5 Neurocrit Care. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 February 01. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Patients—In adjusted models with total PTSD symptom severity, patient’s sex, patient’s age, patient’s race (white), diagnosis (stroke/hemorrhage), and intubation, greater total PTSD symptoms was associated with lower QoL in all four domains (physical QoL β: −.306, p = .017; psychological QoL β: −.502, p < .001; social QoL β: −.315, p = .015; environmental QoL β: −.289, p = .025). Caregivers—In adjusted models with total PTSD symptom severity, caregiver’s sex, caregiver’s age, caregiver’s race (white), patient’s diagnosis (stroke/hemorrhage), and intubation, greater total PTSD symptoms was associated with lower QoL in all four domains (physical QoL β: −.471, p < .001; psychological QoL β: −.622, p < .001; social QoL β: −.373, p = .005; environmental QoL β: −.378, p = .003). Exploratory Analysis of Associations of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Symptom Dimensions on Quality of Life Full details on the exploratory analysis of associations of PTSD symptom dimensions on QoL in patients and caregivers are presented in Table 5. Patients—In adjusted models with all four symptom dimensions, age, and sex, greater numbing symptoms was independently associated with lower psychological QoL (β: −.397, p =.038) and greater re-experiencing symptoms was independently associated with lower physical QoL (β: − .422, p = .047). No other symptom dimensions were associated with QoL domains. Caregivers—In adjusted models with all four symptom dimensions, age, and sex, greater numbing (β: − .409, p=.014) and re-experiencing (β: −.4, p=.041) symptoms were associated with lower physical QoL, and greater numbing symptoms was independently associated with lower psychological (β: −.519, p = .001) and social QoL (β: −.704, p < .001). No other symptom dimensions were associated with QoL domains. Discussion To our knowledge, this was the first study to pilot test the feasibility of assessing PTSD symptoms experienced in the neuro-ICU and their relationship with 3-month QoL in both neurologically intact patients and caregivers. Our preliminary findings demonstrated that for both patients and caregivers, higher total PTSD symptom scores significantly predicted lower physical, psychological, social and environmental QoL at 3 months. In these models, PTSD symptoms explained a small to moderate amount of variance in QoL domains. Our secondary, exploratory, analysis found that greater numbing symptoms predicted lower 3month physical, psychological, and social QoL in caregivers, and lower 3-month psychological QoL in patients. Finally, greater re-experiencing was also predictive of lower 3-month physical QoL in both patients and caregivers. In each of these differential associations, a moderate to large amount of variance in QoL was explained by PTSD symptom dimensions. Our finding that higher total PTSD symptom scores was prospectively associated with lower QoL is consistent with prior research in neurocritical care patients (9) but extends this work Presciutti et al. Page 6 Neurocrit Care. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 February 01. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript by including caregivers and by demonstrating the relationships with specific QoL domains (physical psychological, social and environmental). Thus, our results provide support for the need for early PTSD screening in both neurocritical care patients and caregivers, and the need for developing targeted PTSD interventions in order to improve QoL and recovery trajectories. Our exploratory analysis, which demonstrated moderate to strong relationships between greater numbing symptoms and poor physical, psychological and social QoL in caregivers, and poor psychological QoL in patients, suggests that interventions directly addressing numbing symptoms may be especially important in improving QoL, particularly in caregivers. Numbing has previously been conceptualized as a manifestation of maladaptive coping with the experience of intolerable re-experiencing, active avoidance, and hyperarousal symptoms (29). Because emotional numbing involves decreasing awareness to trauma cues, it is conceptualized as the antithesis of mindfulness, which conversely involves non-judgmental, non-reactive awareness of the present moment (29). Importantly, in neurocritical care patients and caregivers, higher mindfulness has been positively correlated with QoL (13). Further, a recent systematic review concluded that mindfulness-based interventions appear to be effective in treating PTSD (30). Taken together, these findings suggest that interventions that teach mindfulness skills have the potential to decrease emotional numbing and subsequent risk for poor QoL in both neurocritical care patients and caregivers. Notably, the associations between numbing with physical and social QoL in caregivers were not observed in patients. One explanation for this may be that while physical and social QoL are expected to be impacted in patients who recently experienced a brain injury, caregivers instead must juggle their newfound caregiving responsibilities with their previous responsibilities. It is possible that the rigorous physical and temporal demands of caregiving for a neurologically compromised patient may lead to exacerbated numbing symptoms and subsequently reduced self-care, physical activity, and social interactions. Thus, reduced QoL may be an even greater concern for caregivers than for patients. Regarding re-experiencing, greater symptoms in both patients and caregivers were associated with worse physical quality of life at 3-months. Even years after exposure to trauma, intrusive re-experiencing has been linked to an elevated physiological stress response (31) and significantly greater risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in survivors of acute coronary syndrome (4). When considering these previous studies, there may be a mechanistic link between re-experiencing with worsened physical QoL via heightened cardiovascular reactivity to trauma cues. Continued study with relevant biomarkers is needed to confirm these mechanistic hypotheses in neurocritical care patients and caregivers. Importantly, no relationships between PTSD symptom dimensions and environmental QoL were observed, suggesting that no specific symptom dimension drives the total association between PTSD symptoms and environmental QoL. Further study is needed to parse out the relationship between overall PTSD symptoms and environmental QoL in neuro-ICU populations. Presciutti et al. Page 7 Neurocrit Care. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 February 01. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Limitations Our study is not without limitations. First, given our small cohort with heterogenous neuroICU presentations, our findings must be considered preliminary and relevant only to neurologically intact patients and caregivers. Second, in order to meet criteria for full PTSD diagnosis a minimum of 1 month must pass since the index trauma. In the present study, PTSD symptoms were assessed within 2 weeks of neuro-ICU admission, thus participants only may have met PTSD criteria at the 3-month time point, but not at hospitalization. Nevertheless, we have found that PTSD symptoms present during the acute stage of neuroICU admission are predictive of subsequent PTSD symptoms at 3- and 6-months post-neuroICU admission (3). Importantly, given the highly dynamic and unpredictable nature of ICU stay, assessment of PTSD symptoms during ICU admission but prior to 1 month has been utilized in previous studies (2,3,12,17,18,32)). Next, given our moderate sample size, we were unable to conduct factor analyses on our cohort’s PTSD symptoms. As such, we compared our cohort’s PTSD symptoms to QoL using an established 4-factor model of PTSD (19), which has previously been used to characterized neurologically compromised survivors of cardiac arrest (17). Further, the present sample was predominantly white, and thus our findings may not be generalizable to other racial groups. Additionally, intubation is an inexact marker of illness severity and there is the possibility that re-experiencing and numbing may be more sensitive proxies of illness severity in this cohort. Thus, our findings should be considered with caution as elevations in these symptoms could be representative of sicker patients. Next, it should be noted that depression and anxiety were not included in our analyses, despite being important factors in QoL and being collected in the parent study (via the Hospital Depression and Anxiety Scale; HADS). We found a strong correlation between the PCL-C and HADS scores for both patients and caregivers (both r = .7, p <.001) and thus we did not include the HADS in our final regression models. Importantly, when including the HADS and PCL-S scores in the same models, the HADS consistently explained moderate variance across QoL subscales, while the PCL-S no longer demonstrated statistical significance. Because of the dramatic change in the PTSD coefficient when including depression in the same model, previous papers have examined these two predictors in separate models - one with the primary predictor variable being PTSD and one with the primary predictor variable being depression (33–35). Our models do not fully explain the variance in QoL post-NICU stay, though they do demonstrate the problematic association between PTSD and QoL. Finally, dyads enrolled into the parent study only met inclusion if the patient was neurologically intact. There is potential that caregivers of severely neurologically compromised patients may experience even worse PTSD symptoms and lower QoL, and thus dedicated research efforts are needed for these caregivers. Conclusions PTSD assessment during neuro-ICU admission and future QoL follow-up is feasible in both neurologically intact patients and caregivers. Our preliminary findings indicated that greater severity of PTSD symptoms experienced by patients and caregivers during neuro-ICU admission were predictive of worse QoL 3 months later. Early psychological intervention may be warranted in neurocritical care patients and caregivers. Presciutti et al. Page 8 Neurocrit Care. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 February 01.

       " 'Introduction Admission to a neurological intensive care unit (Neuro-ICU) can be a sudden and stressful event for both patients and their caregivers (dyads), and depression and anxiety are common in both Neuro-ICU patients and caregivers. Previously reported rates of clinically significant depression symptoms have ranged from 24 to 44% for patients and 24 to 55% for caregivers [1–5]. Similarly, rates of clinically significant anxiety symptoms have ranged from 40 to 43% for patients and 42 to 46% for caregivers [1–4]. These rates are higher than those observed for other medical cohorts, including general ICU patients  and caregivers . Prior research has shown that acute neurological injuries, such as stroke or transient ischemic attack [9–12], as well as intubation , increase risk for depression and anxiety in patients. For caregivers, role changes and increased responsibilities , as well as uncertainty about their loved one’s prognosis , also serve as important risk factors for depression and anxiety. Quality of life (QoL), or an individual’s perceived well-being and standard of living, is an important Neuro-ICU outcome given the physical, cognitive, and emotional implications of brain injuries and subsequent life changes for both patients and caregivers [15–18]. In subarachnoid hemorrhage patients, 33% reported lower Psychological, Physical, and Social relationships QoL from 3- to 12-months post-discharge  when compared with other Neuro-ICU stroke and hemorrhage patients. Patient and caregiver psychosocial factors are interdependent and can influence outcomes for patient illness trajectory . Despite the emotional toll of an acute neurological injury and subsequent Neuro-ICU admission, few studies have explored depression and anxiety as predictors of QoL trajectories among both patients and caregivers . Prior research, which has focused on patients and rarely the caregivers, or on both individuals together as a dyad , has found that post-traumatic stress in patients can negatively impact caregiver psychological symptoms and QoL . Exploring the dyadic relationship through interdependence modeling can identify the effect that patients and caregivers have on their own and each other’s mental health trajectories [2, 5, 23–27]. An increasing body of research has noted an interdependency between patient and caregiver levels of anxiety in association with patient illness [2, 26–28]. Evidence exists for dyadic patterns of interdependence for emotional distress and admission to a Neuro-ICU and medical-ICU ; however, the impact that depression and anxiety Quinn et al. Page 2 Int J Behav Med. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2025 May 06. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript have on QoL over time in Neuro-ICU dyads remains unknown. In a previous analysis of this dataset, higher patient and caregiver mindfulness and adaptive coping scores at admission predicted one’s own lower 3-month anxiety symptoms, especially caregivers (i.e., actor effects). Further, one’s own baseline anxiety symptom scores had a negative impact on one’s partner’s 3-month anxiety severity (i.e., partner effects) . While this research is important for understanding dyadic relationships between anxiety and coping, the impacts on long-term QoL among these patients and caregivers have not been explored. This study builds on Meyers et al.  by investigating dyadic relationships between depression and anxiety on quality of life to advance our knowledge of the long-term psychological impact of a Neuro-ICU admission on patients and caregivers. This research gap is notable given that depression and anxiety often affect patients long after their Neuro-ICU stay . Research that identifies early psychological risk factors, such as depression and anxiety experienced during Neuro-ICU admission, has the potential to inform treatments aimed at improving QoL and promoting resilience for both dyad members. The present study aims to identify the dyadic association between levels of depression and anxiety for both patients and caregivers within 2 weeks of Neuro-ICU admission with 3-month QoL. We first hypothesize that for both patients and caregivers, one’s own higher depression and anxiety symptom scores at Neuro-ICU admission would be associated with one’s own lower QoL domain scores at 3-months post-discharge . Second, we hypothesize that both patient’s and caregiver’s own depression and anxiety symptom scores at admission will be interdependent with their partner’s lower 3-month QoL domain scores, such that one’s own depression and anxiety at admission will negatively affect one’s partner’s long-term QoL. We discuss potential clinical implications of our findings for addressing depression and anxiety early after the Neuro-ICU, such as resiliency-based interventions [3, 9–12]. Methods Participants and Procedures This study is a secondary analysis of a prospective, longitudinal, observational dataset of patients admitted to the Neuro-ICU and their caregivers . This is the only study from this dataset that investigates the dyadic relationship between anxiety and depression on long-term QoL among Neuro-ICU patients and caregivers. Our team has conducted a series of studies to integrate psychosocial care into Neuro-ICU settings  and inform the development of a novel dyadic resilience intervention . Our team has published other analyses with these data focused on understanding the long-term psychological impact of a Neuro-ICU admission . The Massachusetts General Brigham Institutional Review Board approved all study procedures (2014P002793). We recruited patients admitted to the Neuro-ICU and their caregivers (dyads) within w weeks of Neuro-ICU admission at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, MA, from 2015 to 2016. All participants were cleared for participation by the ICU medical team , and approximately 70% of all admitted patients were eligible to participate in this study . Patient-caregiver dyads completed all baseline measures in the Neuro-ICU and 3-month outcomes post-discharge (follow-up). The majority of caregivers were parents, Quinn et al. Page 3 Int J Behav Med. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2025 May 06. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript children, and siblings in this sample . Dyads were screened at bedside for the following inclusion criteria in patients: (1) 18 years of age or older, (2) literacy and English language fluency, (3) admission to the Neuro-ICU within the previous 2 weeks (most patients were enrolled within 2 days), and (4) communicative patients with transient aphasia or mild cognitive symptoms who were cleared by the medical team for participation. Exclusion criteria for patients, determined with the attending Neuro-ICU clinical team, included (1) inability to complete self-report questionnaires or make personal medical decisions due to their acute neurological injury, (2) possible impending death in the Neuro-ICU, (3) symptomatic chronic aphasia or delirium, and (4) no designated or identified primary, informal caregiver . Inclusion criteria for caregivers included (1) 18 years of age or older, (2) literacy and English language fluency, and (3) primary informal caregiver as determined by the patient. Figure 1 illustrates the participant flowchart. Eligible patients and caregivers completed study measures within 2 weeks of Neuro-ICU (baseline) and at 3-months (follow-up) postdischarge. We conducted paper assessments at bedside and contacted dyads via email (or phone) at follow-up online via REDCap. REDCap is a secure, web-based application for data collection and has been used in our other Neuro-ICU studies with this population . Study staff assisted patients with completion of questionnaires as needed. For follow-up assessment, study staff made three contact attempts before considering a participant as lost to follow-up. Due to significant data lost to 6-month follow-up, we restricted our APIM to the baseline and 3-month follow-up data. Measures Demographic Characteristics and Clinical Variables—We collected patient and caregiver demographic characteristics at admission including sex, age, race, ethnicity, marital status, level of education, employment status, and mental health history. Clinical variables were obtained from the patient’s medical records, including primary neurological diagnosis (stroke/hemorrhage, brain aneurysm, tumor, lesion/brain mass, traumatic brain injury, seizure) and intubation status (yes/no). Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)—We measured depression and anxiety symptoms for both patients and caregivers within 2 weeks of Neuro-ICU admission (baseline) and 3-months post-discharge (follow-up) using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The HADS is a 14-item self-report tool that measures both Anxiety (7 questions) and Depression (7 questions) in the past week . Items are scored on a Likert Scale rating of 0–3 with total scores ranging from 0 to 21. On their respective subscales, total scores of 0–6 indicate no anxiety or depression, and scores of 7 or greater indicate clinically significant symptoms of anxiety or depression . The HADS is both valid and reliable and has been used in other Neuro-ICU settings . Quality of Life: World Health Organization QOL‑BREF (WHOQOL‑BREF)—We tested the impact on 3-month QoL for both patients and caregivers within 2 weeks of Neuro-ICU admission (baseline) and 3-months post-discharge (follow-up) using the WHOQOL-BREF. The WHOQOL-BREF is a 26-item self-report tool that measures QoL Quinn et al. Page 4 Int J Behav Med. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2025 May 06. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript across four domains: (1) the Physical domain addresses perceptions of independence in daily living, general health, energy, work capacity, sleep, and fatigue; (2) the Psychological domains addresses positive and negative emotions and feelings, self-esteem, cognitive function, and meaning making; (3) the Social relationships domain addresses personal life satisfactions, perceptions and availability of social support, and satisfaction with sex life; (4) the Environmental domain addresses physical freedom, safety, security, opportunities for recreation, and time for caregiving . Scores for each domain are transformed, with higher scores (range = 0 to 20) indicating better QoL . As an abbreviated version of the full WHOQOL-100, the WHOQOL-BREF is an easy-to-use, reliable, and valid measure . Statistical Analysis Plan—We ran descriptive statistics to report demographics, clinical characteristics, and study measures using IBM SPSS Statistics (version 25) . We examined associations between these variables at admission for both patients and caregivers using independent-sample t-tests, one-way analysis of variance, chi-square tests of independence, and Pearson correlations as appropriate. Prior to hypothesis testing, we performed validity checks on the study measures, and we ran bivariate correlations for both patients and caregivers as an exploratory analysis to inform the actor-partner interdependence modeling (APIM) . Dyadic analysis must be treated as interdependent; therefore, regression alone cannot address interdependence because it focuses solely upon the individual baseline measures as a predictor of long-term QoL . We used APIM with an online application (  and tested the impact of patients’ and caregivers’ depression and anxiety symptoms at baseline (within 2 weeks of Neuro-ICU admission) and 3-month QoL . We were not able to adjust for demographics within APIM due to the relatively small sample size. APIM is an accepted and popular method for measuring the impact that dyads have on one another and has been used for dyadic comparisons in a Neuro-ICU . In this model, interdependence addresses the relationship between a dyadic association and QoL outcomes due to patient illness . An “actor effect” tests for an individual’s separate baseline depression and anxiety measures predicting his/her own 3-month QoL [2, 23–26]. A “partner effect” tests for a patient’s and caregiver’s baseline anxiety and depression measures predicting his/her partner’s related 3-month QoL [2, 23–26]. We analyzed QoL domains (Physical, Psychological, Social relationships, and Environmental) as outcomes in separate APIM models. Given that depression and anxiety are highly comorbid in Neuro-ICU patients and caregivers, analyzing outcomes from separate composite subscales of depression and anxiety scores from within the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) psychometric measure can assist providers in these settings to treat symptoms concurrently , as well as examine the unique effects of depression and anxiety. Outcomes with p < 0.05 were considered significant and demonstrated an impactful relationship between an individual’s baseline measures and their partner’s 3-month QoL outcomes [2, 23–25]. Quinn et al. Page 5 Int J Behav Med. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2025 May 06. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Results Subject Characteristics Table 1 reports the demographics and diagnosis for the analyzed sample of patients (N = 72, Mage = 52, standard deviation (SD) = 14.9) and caregivers (N = 72, Mage = 51, SD = 13.6). There was a significantly greater proportion of female (63%) than male (37%) caregivers, X2 (1, 71) = 29, p < 0.001, and a significantly greater proportion of male (55%) than female (45%) patients, X2 (1, 71) = 4, p < 0.04. Patients and caregivers did not differ on the remaining demographic variables (p > 0.05). Table 2 presents depression, anxiety, and QoL scores by patients and caregivers. At admission (within 2 weeks), 42% of patients had clinically significant anxiety (HADSA ≥ 7), and 25% of patients had clinically significant depression (HADS-D ≥ 7). Clinically significant anxiety and depression were observed in 50% and 24% of caregivers, respectively. Patients (M = 3.17, SD = 0.55) had significantly lower 3-month QoL within the physical domain than caregivers (M = 3.35, SD = 0.45) (p < 0.03). This may suggest that reductions in physical functioning from an acute neurological injury remained noticeable to patients 3-months post-hospitalization. Patients and caregivers did not significantly differ by depression, anxiety, or QoL at baseline or 3 months. Bivariate Analysis of Patient and Caregiver Depression and Anxiety at Neuro‑ICU Admission with 3‑Month Quality of Life Domains Table 3 presents the bivariate correlations results for patient depression and anxiety scores at admission, and their 3-month QoL (all domains). All 3-month QoL domains are negatively correlated with patient depression symptoms (r = − 0.54 to − 0.69, p < 0.001) and anxiety symptoms (r = − 0.29 to − 0.45, p < 0.01) at admission. Table 4 presents the bivariate correlations for caregiver depression and anxiety scores at admission, and their 3-month QoL (all domains). All 3-month QoL domains are negatively correlated with caregiver depression symptoms (r = − 0.36 to − 0.60, p < 0.01) and caregiver anxiety symptoms (r = − 0.40 to − 0.46, p < 0.001) at admission. These correlations provided support for dyadic hypothesis testing. Effects of Own Depression and Anxiety at Neuro‑ICU on Own 3‑Month Quality of Life Domains (Actor Effects) For patients, baseline depression was negatively associated with 3-month QoL in all domains (β = − 0.53 to − 0.64, p < 0.001) (Table 5) (Figs. 2, 3, 4, and 5). For caregivers, baseline depression was negatively associated with 3-month QoL in two domains: psychological (β = − 0.73, p < 0.001) and social relationships (β = − 0.56, p < 0.001), but not the environmental or physical domains (p > 0.05) (Table 5) (Figs. 2 and 3). For both patients and caregivers, baseline anxiety was not significantly associated with 3-month QoL in all domains (p > 0.05) (Table 5). Quinn et al. Page 6 Int J Behav Med. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2025 May 06. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Effects of Own Depression and Anxiety at Neuro‑ICU on Partner’s 3‑Month Quality of Life Domains (Partner Effects) For caregivers, one’s own baseline depression had a significant, negative association with their partner’s (patient’s) 3-month QoL within the psychological domain (β = − 0.26, p < 0.02) domain and the environmental domain (β = − 0.29, p < 0.03) (Table 5) (Figs. 2 and 4). For patients, one’s own baseline depression had a significant, positive association with their partner’s (caregiver’s) 3-month psychological QoL (β = 0.25, p < 0.02) domain (Table 5) (Fig. 2). For both patients and caregivers, no partner effects were significant for baseline anxiety impacting 3-month QoL. Discussion This prospective study examined the longitudinal association between depression and anxiety at Neuro-ICU admission and 3-month QoL domains (Physical, Psychological, Social relationships, and Environmental) in both patients and caregivers. By examining actor and partner effects in APIM, we found that depression, not anxiety, after NeuroICU admission significantly predicted long-term QoL in patients (all QoL domains) and caregivers (psychological and social relationships). These findings are notable given the high rates of emotional distress among Neuro-ICU patients and caregivers , which exceed other medical cohorts without neurological injuries [6–9, 11]. Our study highlights the need to further explore the psychosocial impacts of Neuro-ICU admission on dyads’ long-term health outcomes. For actor effects, patients’ baseline depression significantly affected their own 3-month QoL in all domains. This significance may be due to the negative impact on a patient’s long-term psychological wellbeing (e.g., emotional distress due to brain injuries, especially stroke survivors) ; physical impairment (e.g., loss of mobility and changes in roles and responsibilities) ; social relationships impairments (e.g., loss of independence, changes in communications skills, and tendency to isolate) ; and environmental impacts (e.g., the amount of time associated with physical recovery and the possible loss of work) . Caregivers’ baseline depression significantly affected their own 3-month QoL in only the psychological and social relationships domains (p < 0.001). In contrast to patients, depressive symptoms after Neuro-ICU admission appear to negatively impact caregiver’s own long-term psychological wellbeing (e.g., emotional distress and self-image) and relationship quality (e.g., perceived loss of social supports) more than physical (e.g., mobility) or environmental QoL (e.g., perceived resources) . Because depression was a significant predictor of lower long-term QoL for both dyad members, our findings suggest that psychosocial treatments in Neuro-ICU settings should address the differential impacts of depression among patients and caregivers. With respect to partner effects, baseline depression in caregivers had a significant negative association with patients’ 3-month QoL within the psychological and environmental domains. Caregivers’ emotional stress after Neuro-ICU can have lasting impacts on patients’ long-term QoL . For example, increased time and burden for caregiving may negatively impact patients and their health recovery more over time . Counterintuitively, we also found that patient depression was associated with higher 3Quinn et al. Page 7 Int J Behav Med. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2025 May 06. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript month psychological QoL in caregivers. The most likely explanation is a false positive result (i.e., type I error) due to running multiple APIM analyses. However, it is possible that caregivers had higher self-esteem and positive attitudes, and thus higher 3-month psychological QoL, after attending to patients’ baseline depressive symptoms. Regardless, additional studies are needed to better understand this relationship and explore potential confounding variables, such as social support network , resilience , mindfulness, and coping skills . The observed toll of depressive symptoms, beyond the influence of anxiety, on both patient and caregiver’s long-term QoL underscores the need to prioritize early assessment and treatment to promote dyads’ mental health in addition to their physical recovery. This finding aligns with similar research that compared elevations in depression and anxiety symptoms in both Neuro-ICU patients and caregivers in comparison to cancer patients and caregivers , as well as mood disorders associated with neurological injuries, such as strokes . Prior research has also shown that patients and caregivers have high levels of anxiety and related post-traumatic stress brought on by Neuro-ICU admission and long-term recovery . Prior research utilizing APIM for the analysis of dyadic interdependence in stem cell transplantation also supports the findings for depression outweighing anxiety for long-term QoL . Our findings suggest that, when examined simultaneously in dyadic models, depression is a stronger predictor of long-term QoL in patients and caregivers. Criteria for depressive disorders may overlap with QoL domain facets, such as insomnia, fatigue, and mobility issues (Physical QoL); lack of or diminished interest in activities, difficulty concentrating, and psychomotor agitation (Psychological and Environmental QoL); and low self-esteem and feelings of hopelessness/helplessness (Social relationships QoL) . The combination of neurological injuries contributing to depression, and the possible alignment of depressive symptoms with QoL domains, points to the need for future research to explore a better understanding of the mechanisms that explain the prominence of depression. The results are consistent with prior research for depression in Neuro-ICU patients [6, 20, 21, 26–28] and expands our understanding by demonstrating the prospective relationship between depression and QoL across four domains. Depression in Neuro-ICU patients increases the risk for a wide range of adverse outcomes, including stroke or hemorrhage , intubation, , decreased physical mobility , less abilities for self-care , and inability or delay in returning to work . Particularly for stroke patients  who were intubated , depression is associated with increased anxiety and post-traumatic stress. After Neuro-ICU discharge, depressive symptoms such as avoidant behavior  may contribute to a “disability spiral” of worsening Physical, Psychological, Social relationships, and Environmental QoL that hinders their ability to regain independence . Previous research has shown that in caregivers of Neuro-ICU patients, higher levels of depression symptoms are associated with increased levels of emotional distress, social isolation, and caregiver burden . Long-term impairments in QoL and depression among caregivers may have negative “spillover effects” on their loved one’s recovery  — a responsibility that should not be faced by Quinn et al. Page 8 Int J Behav Med. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2025 May 06. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript caregivers alone given the toll of the Neuro-ICU admission on their own mental health . The long-term implications of caregiver burden in this population are not fully understood, nor addressed . Our findings suggest that for both patients and caregivers, long-term promotion of QoL may involve early identification and prevention of depression and anxiety symptoms following admission. The findings from this prospective sample contribute to the mounting evidence that psychosocial interventions are needed to prevent chronic emotional distress in patients and caregivers . To fill this treatment gap in Neuro-ICU settings, our team has iteratively developed Recovering Together, a dyadic mindfulness-based and resilience intervention . In an efficacy trial conducted after this prospective study, RT demonstrated the feasibility and preliminary efficacy for reducing depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress in Neuro-ICU patients and caregivers . Such resilience and mindfulness based interventions show promise for reducing depression, anxiety, and psychosocial distress, as well as improving QoL in both patients and caregivers . Future research is needed to understand whether changes in mindfulness and other resilience factors can mediate the relationship between depression and long-term QoL. This study had five key limitations. First, the subsamples were relatively small for contrast and dyadic patterns testing for patients and caregivers (n = 72 each). Nevertheless, our results are meaningful because neuro-ICU patients and caregivers are a challenging population and few studies have successfully compared dyad members. Relatedly, we are unable to determine whether QoL changed beyond the 3-month follow-up due to difficulty maintaining longer-term patient and caregiver participation. Future dyadic studies with larger sample sizes are needed to fully examine the role of patient and caregiver demographic variables, such as sex and age, because of the important influence that these factors have on dyadic QoL . Second, QoL domains were designed for the general population and may be as sensitive to Neuro-ICU patients, especially stroke patients . Third, we recruited neurologically intact patients and their caregivers only to ensure validity of the self-reports. Excluding patients (and their caregivers) with more severe acute neurological injuries may have restricted the range of depression and anxiety symptoms observed. Previous research on proxy assessments has shown that caregivers and clinicians tend to rate patients’ QoL lower than how patients would assess themselves . Fourth, the majority of the sample, conducted at a large medical center, was white and highly educated, which limits the generalizability of our findings to more diverse populations at different treatment settings. Conclusions This study explored the actor-partner effects related to higher depression and anxiety symptoms and long-term QoL from hospitalization through recovery. By examining both patients and caregivers, we contributed to the growing evidence of the importance of identifying psychological symptoms on long-term QoL, especially for high-need Neuro-ICU dyads. Early identification of clinically significant depression at admission can create opportunities for patient and caregiver interventions throughout the Neuro-ICU stay to prevent long-term detrimental effects on QoL. Given the large associations identified in this Quinn et al. Page 9 Int J Behav Med. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2025 May 06. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript study and demands of the Neuro-ICU on staff and dyads, brief assessments of depression, anxiety, and QoL may be sufficient to identify dyads in need of psychological interventions.

       " 'Introduction As the field of neurocritical care continues to grow, patient centered outcomes need to be studied in addition to crude survival and functional outcomes. Critical care-based societies have recommended prioritizing research that encourages survivor focused outcomes.1 Cohort studies from the Neuroscience Intensive Care Unit (NSICU) have often focused on functional outcomes alone.2–5 Resources necessary for transitioning out of the critical care setting is a unique outcome metric that has been previously highlighted as an important unmet need in general critical care.6 To understand how neurocritical care can be improved for survivors, a qualitative assessment of transition needs following discharge is necessary. Although there have been previous studies to determine needs related to post-ICU care transitions, none have been well studied in the neurocritical care patient population.7 For instance, patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have been described previously as having many hurdles in transitioning out of the ICU, moving from a critically ill state into a rehabilitative state, integrating back into society, and frequently struggling with their new life outside of the ICU.8 Discharge checklists, education, and tip sheets have been developed based on input and qualitative interviews from stroke survivors and stroke caregivers, although a limited proportion of stroke patients require the provisions of critical care.9,10 We performed a quality improvement initiative to follow patients with critical neurological injuries11 using a nursing-led strategy to obtain qualitative data pertaining to 1) unmet resources and 2) unanswered questions post-ICU discharge by asking open-ended questions. We hypothesized that by using established thematic content analysis techniques, we would find areas that may be targets for improvement in the discharge and care-transition processes. Rath et al. Page 2 J Neurosci Nurs. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2021 August 01. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Methods This was a quality improvement initiative to understand post-discharge outcomes and qualitative unmet needs and concerns of critically ill patients or their informal caregivers admitted to the neuroscience intensive care unit (NSICU) at the University of Cincinnati, which is a Level 1 trauma center, comprehensive stroke center, and quaternary referral center. Our retrospective reporting of these data were approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the University of Cincinnati with waiver of informed consent. Data collection for this project has been previously described.11 Once neurocritically ill survivors were identified and verified, we performed a scripted telephone assessment between 3–6 months following admission. Data was entered using REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture), a secure, web-based application.12 We preferentially requested to speak to the patient, but then asked if the primary caregiver would answer on the patients’ behalf if the patient was not able to speak. We did not query if the caregiver was a care partner, although it is possible some of the participants may have had formalized care partner relationships. Patients or caregivers were specifically asked 1) if they had adequate resources upon discharge and 2) if they had any unanswered questions or comments. If they answered these open-ended questions, they were encouraged to expand on their responses. Qualitative responses were analyzed using thematic content analysis, using inductive and deductive coding to identify, analyze, and report overarching patterns (themes) and nuanced patterns (codes) across a dataset. Two researchers (NK and KR) independently coded the responses, then met weekly to work through each transcript together. A directed content analysis approach was used to interpret the transcribed data.13 A codebook for each of the two questions was developed collaboratively through discussions among our research team to ensure consistent application of codes. For each code, we included a long definition, short definition, when to use, when not to use, and an example of each code. The code books were agreed on by all team members prior to coding, and inductive changes were made by NK and KR during the formal coding period. When changes to the code book were made, the coders reviewed previously coded interviews with the revised code book to make certain that no previously coded segments were mislabeled. The abbreviated code books are included as Tables 1 and 2. Both coders generated new emergent codes as needed, and later compared and discussed until consensus in coding styles was reached. If the two coders were unable to reach agreement, a third-party adjudicator was used (BF). Throughout the process of coding, emergent patterns, themes, and noteworthy statements were documented, as a way to provide analytical depth, identify illustrative quotes, and highlight points for further discussion. The proportion of themes for each major neurocritical care diagnosis, length of stay, and discharge destination were examined. Rath et al. Page 3 J Neurosci Nurs. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2021 August 01. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Results Patient identification: A total of 1324/2163 patients fulfilled our inclusion criteria (see Figure, Supplemental Digital Content 1, which describes study flow). Of those, a total of 365/1324 (27.6%) died in the hospital whereas another 150 died after discharge for a follow-up mortality of 515/1324 (38.9%). Of 959 hospital survivors, 557 were reached by the study team at 4.4 +/− 0.8 months after their initial admission. 232 provided a qualitative response to open ended questions. Demographics of those who provided qualitative responses were compared to those who did not (see Table, Supplemental Digital Content 4). The two groups were similar in proportions of race, primary diagnosis, hospital length of stay, discharge destination, and whether the responses were from the survivor or a caregiver. The two groups were significantly different in that male patients or caregivers of male patients were more likely than female patients or caregivers of female patients to provide a qualitative response, and patients with an ICU stay of <72 hours were less likely to provide a qualitative response compared to those with an ICU stay of >72 hours. Qualitative Analysis: Resources at discharge—Comments regarding patient resources at discharge fell into five major themes: 1) satisfied 2) it was okay, but something happened that could be improved 3) dissatisfied with ICU and discharge 4) post-ICU care was bad 4) and ongoing health concerns. Each of the themes contained more specific, targetable codes. There was 94.7% agreement for codes in patient resources at discharge. The most commonly described theme for patient resources at discharge was, “It was okay.” This theme broadly described caregiver responses that pointed out specific areas upon discharge where their needs were not met. This included several codes such as patients reporting no home care, no appointment, unclear discharge instructions, or insurance issues. The most commonly coded unmet need overall for discharge was premature discharge (n = 12). Additional commonly coded responses to the open-ended question about resources upon discharge were unclear discharge (n = 11), poorly prepared (n = 9), and ghosted (n = 9). The most commonly coded theme regarding resources at discharge (based on percent of total codes within each diagnosis) for all major diagnoses is included in Supplemental Digital Content 2. Individuals who were admitted for a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) or seizures/status epilepticus reported poorer ICU discharge processes when compared to other major diagnoses. Additionally, only individuals with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) reported any satisfaction with the discharge process. Patients with an ICU LOS >72 hours had a higher proportion of responses reporting a poor discharge process, less satisfaction, and poor post-ICU care compared to those in the ICU < 72 hours. Patients who were discharged from the hospital to a skilled nursing facility (SNF) were most likely to report poor post-ICU care, and those who were discharged to inpatient rehabilitation were least likely to report poor post-ICU care (Supplemental Digital Content 5). Unanswered Questions—Unanswered questions or comments after discharge fell into six themes, 1) neutral 2) positive, 3) negative, 4) medical questions, 5) ongoing medical Rath et al. Page 4 J Neurosci Nurs. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2021 August 01. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript concern or questions, or 6) remembrance. There was 99% agreement in coding the unanswered questions or comments. Within these themes, several common codes emerged. The most common codes for unanswered questions after discharge were in the theme title, “positive care,” which included Good care in the ICU (115), Enthusiasm for institution (33), and Grateful (31). The most common theme in response to unanswered questions (based on percent of total codes that occurred for each diagnosis) for each major diagnosis is listed in Supplemental Digital Content 3. Commonly coded responses within the theme of “areas of improvement” were bad post-ICU care (n = 15), lacking follow up (n = 15), recovery needs (n = 15), disease complication (n = 14), and got info (n = 14). Individuals with TBI reported much fewer positive responses compared to other diagnoses, with only 5% of responses positive, compared to the next lowest, which was 39%. Patients discharged home had the highest proportion of positive comments about their ICU stay. Discussion Our study is the first to describe the neurocritical care discharge process. The use of openended post-ICU assessments such as this can inform iterative changes in practice that can be evaluated based on changes in the perception of needs with the potential to provide evidence for practices such as discharge education that are untestable via traditional clinical trial design.14 Our findings suggest that there are many unmet needs and concerns related to transition out of the ICU in a complicated neurocritically ill patient population for which we can develop further improvements in care. The most common unmet need regarding resources after discharge was that caregivers perceived their loved one was prematurely discharged, or they felt unprepared to leave the ICU with their loved one. Patients who are medically not prepared for ICU discharge do have worse outcomes, but the perception that a loved one was prematurely discharged has not been associated with worse outcomes.15 It is likely that the sense of being prematurely discharged may be felt by caregivers of loved ones who received little information, education, or follow-up regarding the next phases of care after the ICU. It is also possible that during the time in ICU, patients and/or caregivers had difficulty receiving information due to low health literacy, cognitive or memory distortions due to stress or illness, or they were simply overwhelmed at the time. Patients and caregivers reported that home health services were challenging to obtain, and were expecting services beyond the scope of home health care, which is consistent with previous qualitative studies of discharged hospital patients.16 This may have contributed to the sense of premature discharge. Many patients and caregivers also spoke subjectively about how long it had taken them to recover, and that they were surprised by the amount of time they experienced residual neurologic deficits. Although this is consistent with published timelines of neuro-recovery, additional education at the time of discharge may have allowed patients and caregivers to develop a framework for the timing of recovery, and may have decreased the number who reported the perception of a premature discharge.17 We targeted the use of qualitative methods to study discharge unmet needs and concerns, as no other quantitative measure would be specific enough to obtain this information. One Rath et al. Page 5 J Neurosci Nurs. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2021 August 01. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript similar prior systematic review of four qualitative studies of pediatric intensive care unit transitions has been published, describing that the period of ICU discharge was emotionally, physically, and socially challenging, with the perception of little targeted support for families during this vulnerable time.18 Future studies should seek to develop comprehensive discharge processes from the neuro ICU that incorporate family support and education. We found that patients with a longer ICU stay (> 72 hours) had a higher proportion of responses that indicated a poor discharge process, and more frequently reported poor post ICU care, compared to those with a shorter ICU stay (<72 hours). Although this study was not designed to determine the reasons for this finding, it is likely that patients with a longer ICU stay are more medically complex, and require additional services and preparation prior to ICU discharge. Further, patients who were discharged to a SNF were more likely to report poor post-ICU care compared to other discharge destinations. Previously published evidence, however, has reported that satisfaction with SNF placement can be improved if patients and families are both educated and involved in the decision about location, type, and mobility goals of a skilled nursing facility stay.19–21 Individuals with TBI reported the lowest levels of positive responses when asked about any concerns. While this study is unable to make inferences for why this was the case, many respondents with TBI described complex, hectic discharges with numerous specialists and ancillary providers necessary for their post-ICU care. However, some unmet needs were common in all groups of patients, such as financial counseling, neuro-recovery education, or increased access to home health services, and could be addressed within the larger neurocritical care cohort to streamline options for patients and caregivers in these realms. Limitations: Our study was limited in that it was a quality improvement initiative rather than a formal clinical observational cohort study. While one of the authors performed the majority of the data entry and quality (ELS) and another the majority of the phone call follow-up (OL), different personnel participated over time which may have altered the qualitative responses from caregivers and their willingness to speak with study personnel. There is risk of bias, as some patients/caregivers chose to not provide qualitative responses. However, those who did provide qualitative responses did not have significant demographic differences, other than gender, compared to those who did not provide responses. Our analysis only used patients within a single institution, so other institutions with differing discharge processes may have other findings. We used telephone contact as our method for follow up and qualitative assessments. Qualitative assessments may have been different if obtained in person. Also, our qualitative information was obtained 3–6 months after the hospitalization. While this allowed patients or caregivers to place their ICU discharge in perspective, it may have led to responses that were subject to recall bias due to the length of time that had passed, the neurologic injury itself, or post-traumatic stress.

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Conclusions: We found that the use of a qualitative assessment of unmet needs and concerns of survivors and caregivers regarding discharge from the NSICU was both feasible, and provided information that will allow us to make meaningful changes to the NSICU discharge process. Female survivors and caregivers of female survivors were less likely to provide qualitative responses, and future studies should explore if their needs differ. A neurocritical care intervention that entails a streamlined ICU discharge process that would ensure follow-up, provide education on post ICU care, and include a specific number to call in the event of questions may reduce problems that were brought up in this study. This intervention would provide a meaningful way for nurses to contribute to patient/caregiver wellness after a neurocritical illness, as well as provide a smoother transition from the ICU setting to the rehabilitation and outpatient settings. Although ICU discharge needs were apparent in all types of neurocritically ill patients, those who required a higher level of care after discharge or had a longer ICU stay reported more dissatisfaction with post-ICU care and the ICU discharge process, and may represent a population who would benefit from a tailored intervention to address discharge needs. In instances where the patient was not able to speak, caregivers provided valuable insight, and should be involved in future qualitative assessments of discharge processes.',\n",
       " 'Introduction The ﬁeld of critical care rapidly expanded starting in the 1950s, with advancing life support that reduced mortality for previously fatal organ dysfunction1; however, research into the long-term consequences of surviving these extremes of physiology did not begin in earnest until the 1990s.2,3 Since then, a large body of evidence has documented the impairments, disabilities, symptom burden, and health care costs associated with ICU survivorship, which can last for years.4,5 In 2012, the term post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) was ﬁrst described to facilitate communication and research into impairments following critical illness—originally categorized into physical, cognitive, and mental healthrelated domains.6 Despite a quarter century of improvement in our understanding of the epidemiology of PICS, there is still poor awareness of the problem and infrequent communication between the medical team and patients.7,8 Incidence Although the incidence of PICS varies based on patient population, data from cohort studies suggest that it is common, occurring in up to 1 of every 2 ICU patients who survive to discharge. An analysis of 406 ICU survivors (median age, 61 years) found that only 44% were considered “PICS-free” at 12 months. At 3 months, 38% had cognitive impairment, 26% had physical disabilities with new limitations in activities of daily living, and 33% experienced symptoms of depression.9 A questionnaire-based study analyzed by ICU admission type showed the incidence of PICS at 1 year to be 43% for elective surgery requiring ICU admission, 58% for medical ICU admission, and 64% for urgent surgical ICU admission.10 Additionally, the term PICS-Family describes the wide-ranging and often underrecognized effects that an ICU admission can have on a patient’s caregivers and family. These include mental health problems such as anxiety, depression, and PTSD at rates similar to or exceeding those of the ICU survivor.11,12 Recovery Trajectories and Risk Factors Understanding a patient’s clinical and functional status before the ICU, including baseline frailty, disabilities, comorbidities, and age, is paramount in understanding the most probable trajectory of recovery.13,14 One study of 109 patients with ARDS with a median age of 44 years and few preexisting comorbidities found an 85% survival rate out to 2 years among those who survived to hospital discharge, with most returning to work and essentially all returning to independent living.15 In contrast, a cohort of 303 medical-surgical adult patients (median age of 62 years), who predominantly lived independently at home without preexisting physical or cognitive impairments, found that 43% had died within 6 months, and of the survivors less than one-third returned to their reported baseline functional status.16 At the upper end of age and frailty, Ferrante and colleagues17 described a large prospective community cohort assessed longitudinally for over a decade. Within this cohort, 291 adult patients (median age, 84 years) were admitted to an ICU and were categorized into 3 pre-ICU functional trajectories: minimal disability, mild to moderate disability, and severe disability. Both mortality and postICU functional status were worse with increasing preICU level of disability. Overall, more than one-half chestjournal.org 925 experienced functional decline or early death. Finally, an observational study of over 1,500 ICU survivors emphasized this point further; among baseline characteristics, the strongest predictors for death within 1 year of ICU discharge were age, comorbidities, and loss of autonomy (ie, complete activities of daily living disability) at time of ICU admission.18 Severity of illness and complications during an ICU stay also play a major role in long-term trajectories. Delirium duration is 1 of the strongest independent predictors of cognitive impairment and disability after discharge,19,20 emphasizing the need to prevent, monitor, and treat delirium to improve long-term outcomes. Length of mechanical ventilation, shock, and ICU length of stay (LOS) are also risk factors for decline in post-ICU functional status (Fig 1).17,21 Despite these known risk factors, few prediction models have been developed and validated. A recent systematic review found only 3 PICS-related prediction models.22 Since then, a model to predict the occurrence of PICS was developed and validated in a broad ICU cohort.23,24 Given providers’ low accuracy in predicting functional outcomes after the ICU,8 continued efforts at developing and implementing these models are necessary to help us advance our prognostication and communication to patients and families. Communication and Empathy in the ICU Communication is a cornerstone of providing highquality medical care, yet it has been recognized in both inpatient and outpatient medicine that physicians do not routinely discuss the long-term implications of serious illnesses.25 For example, more than one-half of patients with metastatic lung or colorectal cancer were unaware that chemotherapy would be unlikely to cure their disease.26 Although discussion of functional outcomes is often part of meetings between ICU providers and families,27 discordance in prognostic understanding is rife.28,29 Highlighting this fact, Cox and colleagues30 found that among 126 recipients of prolonged mechanical ventilation followed over 1 year, 83% of surrogates expected a good quality of life, whereas only 4% of physicians expected the same.30 Barriers to improving these pivotal conversations have been identiﬁed to include unrealistic surrogate optimism about recovery expectations, a lack of contact between intensivists and patients after discharge, and minimal conﬁdence from intensivists in applying existing outcomes research to individual patients.31 Although evidence regarding best medical communication strategy is mixed,32 guidelines agree shared decision-making should start with information exchange and take into account the patient’s values and preferences.33 These values and preferences must be individualized, but qualitative data have suggested key themes that focus on avoiding functional impairments. In questionnaires of over 200 seriously ill outpatients, fewer participants reported they would choose treatments expected to result in physical or cognitive impairment than treatments that could result in death.34 Auriemma and colleagues35 likewise found in interviews with ICU survivors or surrogates that survival alone was inadequate as a goal. One-half focused on also maintaining physical or cognitive function as a meaningful outcome, with severe disability in these categories being considered a fate worse than death.35 These studies eloquently highlight what might be intuitive to many of us, that patients are humans who want to feel they have “a life worth living.” The topic of communicating recovery from critical illness would be incomplete without discussion about the importance of provider empathy. Sympathy is when we feel “for” someone; empathy is when we feel “with” someone. It can have beneﬁts of patient satisfaction, improved communication with and acknowledgment of the individual patient, but also a degree of risk from “compassion fatigue.”36 Empathy in the ICU is a multifaceted concept and should include components of understanding a patient’s condition, sensing what matters most to them, and Cognitive Physical Mental Health Pre-ICU Status In-Hospital Factors Risk of PICS Age Comorbidities Frailty Pre-ICU Trajectory Hearing or Vision Impairment Delirium Mechanical Ventilation Shock Sepsis Immobilization Figure 1 – Major risk factors associated with development of PICS. PICS ¼ post-intensive care syndrome. 926 How I Do It [ 1 6 8 # 4 C H E S T O C T O B E R 2 0 2 5 ] providing both support and communication (Fig 2).36 The ﬁrst section of this article offers readers the understanding that patients’ recovery outcomes are inﬂuenced by their pre-ICU status and known risk factors. We then must genuinely inquire why the recovery matters to the patient. Is she an avid gardener, in which case meaningful recovery must include getting her hands in soil again? Is he a grandfather who ﬁnds joy in spending time with his grandchildren? What degree of recovery will be required to engage with them at a level he judges as meaningful? A willingness to have conversations about a meaningful life outside of the ICU provides a common goal for discussions on recovery. The third component, providing support and communication, is discussed next. How I Do It As represented in our case examples, many patients receive inadequate preparation and discussion about common sequelae of critical illness. We pride ourselves on “saving lives,” yet too often we stumble at the ﬁnish line by leaving patients to discover for themselves the lingering effects of critical illness. Here we introduce a framework of how to improve this crucial component of ICU care, using an empathy-focused mindset incorporating prevention, awareness, preparation, and support (Fig 3). The initial phase of a patient’s ICU course often includes critical stabilization and life-sustaining therapies. At that time, survival is often uncertain. Nevertheless, families are usually hopeful and want to know what steps we can take to improve the likelihood of survival and reduce the risk of long-term impairments. The ABCDEF bundle (aka, A2F bundle; Fig 4) is an evidence-based set of 6 steps that aim toward an “awake and walking” ICU culture.37 The A2F bundle is a way to bring a humanistic approach to ICU care with the backing of rigorous scientiﬁc evidence.37-39 Higher compliance with the A2F bundle’s 6 steps has been shown to reduce delirium, ICU LOS, mortality, and ICU readmissions in a dosedependent manner.38,39 By decreasing delirium and ICU LOS, 2 variables mentioned as risk factors for PICS and worse functional trajectory following critical illness, we see this as a key component to decreasing the burden of PICS. Communicating the A2F bundle to families demonstrates that we are diligently providing holistic care and allows us to encourage their bedside participation. Higher family engagement during the COVID-19 pandemic decreased risk of delirium,40 and families should be aware of both the measurable and unmeasurable beneﬁts of being at bedside when able. For those patients in the ICU who survive their initial critical illness and have increasing likelihood of hospital survival, we begin to counsel patients and families on the recovery that lay ahead. Here, plain language and awareness of both health literacy and cultural differences is key in effective communication.41 We share that many ICU survivors face impairments or challenges after the hospital. We personalize these conversations to show Understanding the patient’s medical condition Sensing what matters most to the patient Providing communication and support to the patient and family Figure 2 – Components of empathy in ICU communication. chestjournal.org 927 empathy for the individual and an eye toward survivorship: I’m so glad that your father has improved from his critical illness. We’re hopeful that he’ll continue progressing towards leaving the ICU, but it’s important to be aware he might not immediately be capable of playing bridge or pickleball again because of the concentration and mobility problems many patients face after the ICU. We’ve been diligent about keeping him awake and walking daily to help him keep his muscles and brain as strong as possible so he’ll have less of these challenges. We include similar language in any major update to the family. As ICU discharge draws closer, we introduce more details while taking care to avoid jargon or overburdening the family. We review the various domains of PICS and emphasize that, although severity varies, these problems can occur in up to one-half of ICU survivors so that we normalize any impairments that may occur. We help prepare families by using the risk factors above to give qualitative assessments of possible recovery trajectories and take into consideration the patient’s initial characteristics—age, frailty, recent functional trajectory, and comorbidities—and inhospital risk factors of delirium, sepsis, shock, mechanical ventilation and ICU LOS (Fig 1). We also emphasize that not every patient experiences PICS,9 and PICS-related symptoms can improve over months and years, admitting to the uncertainty inherent to predicting how any individual may recover.42,43 PICS affects more than patients, and we share with caregivers Assess, Prevent and Manage Pain A B C E D F Both SAT and SBT Delirium: Assess, Prevent and Manage Family Engagement and Empowerment Choice of Analgesia and Sedation Early Mobility and Exercise Figure 4 – A2F bundle framework.

We then introduce PICS so that patients and families are aware of the domains. We emphasize the need to prepare for these possible impairments before ICU discharge. Finally, we refer to an ICU Recovery Clinic so that we can continue to support patients and families, and re-iterate the previous two steps.

We give anticipatory guidance to ease the transition of leaving the hospital and to help align expectations for what might be a new quality of life.44 Despite even the best attempts at these practices, patients and families often still leave the hospital with questions on medications, insurance, referrals, and more. ICU recovery clinics are multidisciplinary care teams that can emphasize all the prior points in the outpatient setting, where patients have had time to begin recovery. These clinics improve an ICU survivor’s reported quality of life and potentially decrease readmissions by addressing the aforementioned problems, as well as providing access to peer support and palliative care.45-49 The multidisciplinary approach includes a pharmacist, psychologist, case manager, and ICU physician. Medications are reviewed and changes usually required, screening tools for PICS are performed, and referrals are placed when indicated. When a recovery clinic is not available, primary care providers must overcome barriers to caring for the complexities of a post-ICU patient50; we ﬁnd that the awareness and preparation communicated to patients and families in the ICU can help but does not lessen the need for further research in improving recovery in the post-ICU period. Applying Our Framework Case 1 (A young, previously healthy woman who survived ARDS but suffers PTSD and cognitive impairment): Ms. Smith, I can only imagine what you’ve been through these last 2 weeks. You were on the ventilator to support failing lungs. I’m so glad you’re getting better, but it’s important to remember that there is still a long road to full recovery ahead. Often it takes the body and brain longer to get well than it takes them to get sick. However, most people who come into the ICU at your young age, and in such previous good state of health, will return to close to their baseline or even back to baseline. Remember, though, that a large fraction will have impairments over the ﬁrst several months, and some of these could even last longer. For you, that might mean difﬁculty immediately returning to your job as a computer programmer or remembering the details needed to manage your household with 2 kids. As an ICU survivor, you may develop mental health problems from the suffering you went through. We did our best to lower your risk of developing these problems by minimizing sedation and keeping you mobile. This is a lot to take in after what you’ve been through, and our ICU recovery clinic would be happy to see you after discharge. They can screen for these problems and provide available resources. You’re not alone in your recovery. Case 2 (Older man with biliary septic shock who developed an accelerated dementia and mobility problems [Discussing with family because patient is still delirious]): We know that your father has had a very challenging last 2 weeks in the ICU. He required immense life support and as you can see is still recovering. You mentioned that before the ICU he was sharp, witty, and could do most daily tasks by himself. We certainly hope he makes a speedy recovery home to care for his dogs who he loves taking for daily walks, but we know that patients his age will typically require more assistance after the ICU than before. This might mean trouble with performing his favorite crossword puzzles or remembering names of grandchildren. These symptoms can have an impact on his quality of life. We did our best to minimize the risk of these impairments with the “bundle of care” we discussed each day on rounds. With the amount of delirium he suffered, it’s still very likely that he’ll have some degree of problems with his memory, concentration, and decisionmaking for some time. Continuing with his physical and occupational rehabilitation will likely speed his recovery. It is worth you being aware and prepared that he will likely need more help around the house and with things like ﬁnances or medications for several months and perhaps even years to come. Our ICU recovery clinic can provide testing to evaluate any of the residual consequences of his critical illness, and referrals for needed medical or social work services. He is not alone in his recovery. Let’s also remember that you as a family have been a part of his suffering, and families experience challenges with mental health struggles just as often as patients. Our recovery clinic has a support group for caregivers like yourself. Conclusion Communicating PICS to patients and families is paramount in easing the often difﬁcult transition that can occur for individuals who survive the ICU. Patients and families should know about and be part of an A2F bundle approach to improving long-term outcomes. Using empathy and an understanding of risk factors, we chestjournal.org 929 advocate for providing awareness of and preparation for PICS while in the ICU. These conversations must continue after hospital discharge with dedicated ICU recovery clinics or primary care. Financial/Nonﬁnancial Disclosures The authors have reported to CHEST the following: M.

       " 'S70 CLEVELAND CLINIC JOURNAL OF MEDICINE VOLUME 76 • SUPPLEMENT 2 APRIL 2009 ABSTRACT Q Emory University Hospital recently converted its neurocritical care unit into an environment that enhances involvement of the patient’s family. Each patient room now has an adjacent family area with comfortable accommodations for daytime and nighttime use. The new unit design, which drew from evidence on the impact of the physical environment on patient outcomes, facilitates better interactions between families and the medical team, and early studies show that patient satisfaction and staff satisfaction have increased. This article describes the impetus for and process of the unit redesign, as well as initial results and lessons learned. A lthough my medical training prepared me well for treating brain injuries, I learned very little about caring for the enormous emotional needs of patients in neurocritical care units and their families. Having a physical environment that encourages the participation of the patient’s family is extremely important. Not only can having loved ones nearby give great comfort to the patient, but it helps provide a critically ill patient with an identity, which affects quality of care in fundamental ways. Having an identity is an anchor for everything, ultimately infl uencing not only clinical care but research as well. This article describes our experience in developing a new neurocritical care environment at Emory University Hospital over the last 10 years using an evidence-based design centered on caring for patients and their families. Q STARTING POINT: A RAPIDLY GROWING PATIENT POPULATION Emory University Hospital, part of the Emory Healthcare health system, is the largest medical center in Georgia, with 43 neuroscience fl oor beds, 27 dedicated neurocritical care beds, and 10 intermediate neurocritical care beds. We have experienced rapid growth, with neurocritical care admissions rising from 587 in 1999 to more than 1,400 in 2007. We treat patients with meningitis, brain aneurysms, tumors, massive strokes, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenia gravis, and other severe problems. When we proposed building a replacement neurocritical care unit, we fi rst appealed to the bottom line: if we had more beds and could attract more patients, we would generate more revenue. The hospital’s mission stated that we had to take care of patients with neurological emergencies because no one else in town could. The administration countered with predictable restrictions: because Emory University was at that time considering building an expensive replacement hospital, they did not want to spend a lot of money improving a single unit. They agreed only to meet the state and federal requirements so that we could quickly open up and receive additional patients. The initial design was for a 24-bed intensive care unit (ICU) with a “track” around it: visitors would enter patient rooms from the back so as not to disrupt the central area used by the doctors and nurses. The rooms measured 200 square feet, as required by the state of Georgia, with no dedicated space for family members. This design actually duplicated the system we already had in many ways. Q TRADITIONAL SYSTEM: PATIENTS SURROUNDED BY EQUIPMENT, NOT FAMILY In our old unit, the typical patient room was so crowded with specialized equipment that it was virtually impossible to get to the patient without tripping over cords and knocking out catheters. It took some time to respond to an emergency, and maintaining OWEN SAMUELS, MD Director, Neurosciences Critical Care Unit, Emory University Hospital, Atlanta, GA Redesigning the neurocritical care unit to enhance family participation and improve outcomes Dr. Samuels reported that he has no ﬁ nancial interests or relationships that pose a potential conﬂ ict of interest with this article.

Downloaded from CLEVELAND CLINIC JOURNAL OF MEDICINE VOLUME 76 • SUPPLEMENT 2 APRIL 2009 S71 SAMUELS sterility in such an environment was obviously diffi cult. During rounds, residents, fellows, and the multidisciplinary team practically fell over one another, and actually seeing the patient in the midst of all this was a challenge. In the central area, nurses were crowded around desks with charts spread all over tables, increasing the potential for mistakes in recordkeeping and medications. Where were the families? We previously had a dark, dingy common space in the outside hallway, well away from patients. Families were prohibited from being in patient rooms during rounds for fear they should misinterpret or be alarmed by something they heard. Discussions between doctors and families took place either in the cluttered patient room or in a public area. Imagine this in situations in which a patient’s prognosis was poor and discussion was needed regarding brain death and organ donation. The new space promised little more than some new converter chair/ beds in the common areas. I did not have a clear idea of exactly what we needed, but I knew that the proposed design was not it. EVIDENCE FOR A BETTER WAY Q To convince the administration that we should pursue a completely new concept, we focused on key people: the chief executive offi cer of Emory Healthcare and the chief nursing offi cer of the neurosciences critical care unit. We told them that the current ICU was terrible for families and was inherently dangerous. The potential for medical mistakes was enormous and probably largely unrecognized. Staff burnout was also a potential issue: we reminded them of the tremendous nursing turnover, especially with our aging nursing population. We also told them that we believed there was a better way. The medical community bases clinical decisions, such as choosing a drug to treat infection, on evidence from the literature. Shouldn’t such evidence also inform how we design hospitals and ICUs? I rapidly learned that convincing scientifi c evidence exists that the physical environment affects outcome.1 The literature shows that we can empower families and staff and signifi cantly reduce cost. We proposed a new design founded on an evidencebased approach for patient- and family-centered care. We were confi dent that a better design could reduce staff stress and enhance performance, and we hoped it could also reduce costs and improve effectiveness. As an academic institution, we wanted to measure such factors and continue to study this issue by building a living laboratory of a new type of family-centered ICU. We also wanted every treatment tool available while remaining fl exible enough that we could continue to change in the future. Most importantly, we wanted to keep patients the center of our focus. EMPHASIS ON FAMILY INVOLVEMENT Q We sometimes fool ourselves into thinking that technology improves outcomes when, in fact, many other factors may be more benefi cial. When we designed the ICU we had several goals or “design drivers” in mind, with accompanying measurable outcomes to be tracked (Table 1). Our primary driver was support for families. We proposed completely eliminating all the signs restricting visitors to the ICU, such as those reading, “No visiting: Physician rounds in progress” (we were tempted to rewrite that sign as, “Physician rounds in progress: Visitor presence mandatory”). Rarely is the family actually required to participate in the care of a patient; we have no contract with the family delineating what the health care system provides and what we expect the family to do. We planned for a family zone in the patient room, a children’s room, lockers and showers, and a family quiet room. Outcome measures would be patient/ family satisfaction and provider satisfaction based on surveys, as well as the number of patient/family complaints and the number of litigation fi lings. Other important drivers were the desire to support more procedures at the bedside, reduce infection, reduce medical errors, and increase patient safety. Every goal had measurable outcomes to be tracked. DESIGN PROCESS WAS DYNAMIC Q To help determine factors such as patient room size and confi guration as well as the design of family spaces, we analyzed best practices of the prior 10 years’ winners of the ICU Design Citation Award, which is given jointly by the Society of Critical Care Medicine, the American Association of Critical Care Nurses, and the American Institute of Architects Academy on Architecture for Health. We partnered with the division of health care design at Georgia Institute of Technology’s College of Architecture as well as with a psychologist specializing in the role of the physical environment and with numerous graduate students. Several architectural design brainstorming meetings were held. We then created a simulation that consisted of a large mock-up of the proposed ICU, including a nurses’ station, patient rooms, booms, and family areas. We spent an entire day role-playing a variety on January 17, 2026. For personal use only. All other uses require permission.

Videographers recorded everything for later analysis. We changed designs as we learned from such experiences. We originally planned to distribute the nurses’ stations throughout the ICU but later decided to keep a communal area as well, recognizing that nurses and doctors like to be with each other and need to support one another. About 50 family members of patients who had graduated from or were still in the critical care unit were involved with the unit’s design throughout the process. PROPOSAL BECOMES REALITY Q The new unit opened February 2007. The new rooms range from 345 to 450 square feet, compared with 120 to 200 square feet for the old rooms. Each room is a suite, consisting of the patient room and a family area separated by a curved wall with large glass-block windows that let in light and create a cocoon-like effect (Figure 1). The family area has a table, chairs, comfortable sleeping arrangements, a fl at-screen television, wireless Internet access, music, and a whitenoise system to blunt surrounding noises. The new unit allows us to do things we could not do before. I can now easily hold a private conversation with a family member when I visit a patient. Family members can leave the room for some respite and still be just a stone’s throw away from their loved one. Patient rooms are much bigger than before, and the booms lift a lot of equipment off the fl oor. The beds and doors are confi gured so that patients who are awake have a direct line of sight to the nurse’s station. MEDIA ATTENTION AND REACTIONS Q Our new unit was featured in both an article2 and a health care blog3 by the Wall Street Journal. The article opened as follows: “For decades, hospitals tried to keep visitors out of intensive-care units for more than a few minutes at a time. This year, Emory University Hospital here went the other way: It began inviting family members to move into the ward and take a hand in the patient’s care.”2 I think the reporter captured the key idea well, but I would change the word “visitors” to “participants” to indicate that patients’ family members really have a degree of responsibility. There were interesting comments from readers in response to the article. Many were positive, but not TABLE 1 Redesign principles: drivers, responses, measurable outcomes Design drivers Design response Outcome measures Support families Support more procedures at the bedside Reduce infection Reduce medical errors and increase patient safety ICU = intensive care unit; MRSA = methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus Family zone in patient room Greater satisfaction on Press-Ganey and Emory ICU surveys Kids’ room Fewer complaints and litigation Lockers and showers Family quiet room Medical gas booms Fewer patient transfer complications and lower costs Larger patient zone Fewer errors Improved ergonomics Shorter stays More time spent by ICU staff in the ICU area Numerous rubs and handwashing stations Improved handwashing compliance Lower MRSA and nosocomial infection rates Improved ceiling tiles Fewer medical and medication errors Carpet where appropriate Less litigation Charting niches Reduced self-extubation Zoned caregiver area Decreased falls and injuries related to patients leaving beds on January 17, 2026.

Downloaded from CLEVELAND CLINIC JOURNAL OF MEDICINE VOLUME 76 • SUPPLEMENT 2 APRIL 2009 S73 SAMUELS everyone felt the changes were a good idea. One reader wrote, “Pandering to a half-dozen relatives is rarely benefi cial to anyone. When we realize that hospitals are there to heal and not to entertain, we’ll cut down the excess costs of treating critical care patients. A close relative is entitled to know what’s happening on a timely basis. Any involvement beyond that should be limited to what is medically benefi cial to the patient.” Another comment, probably from someone who works in an ICU, was, “This sounds more like a marketing ploy by hospital administrators than a plan developed by the nurses and physicians in the trenches.” Interestingly, administrators at Emory resisted the changes because of the high expense. Although the tone of this comment seems cynical, the writer brings up a valid danger—that limited health care resources potentially could be diverted from the patient to the family. But although care that fosters family participation costs more money and takes more energy, what matters is that we are doing a better job for patients and their families. Q BENEFITS OF FAMILY-CENTERED UNITS: A CASE STUDY The following case study illustrates some of the advantages of our new family-centered unit. David was a 31-year-old computer programmer, the father of a 3-year-old girl, and about to be married. He came in with a grade 3 subarachnoid hemorrhage from a severe carotid intracranial aneurysm. He was in the old neurocritical care unit for 4 or 5 days, and then was moved to the new unit when it opened. The family—David’s parents and his fi ancée— kept a rotating vigil. The Wall Street Journal article described how they always felt that they were in the way in the old ICU, whereas they felt welcome in the new facility. The family often stood at David’s bedside as the team explained the purpose of the complex monitors and instruments. The mother said, “This was our home for a month, and it got so that the nurses could tell when we needed a hug.”2 After 2 weeks, David developed neurogenic pulmonary edema, severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and heart failure. We induced a coma to protect his brain from high intracranial pressure and placed hypothermia catheters to lower his core temperature in an attempt to better oxygenate him. Just as he was getting better, the aneurysm ruptured again, and we knew that recovery was hopeless. The family was by his bedside 24 hours a day and knew that the medical team was as well. They witnessed the whole situation and understood when we ran out of options. As David’s parents and fi ancée gathered at the bedside, I told them that David had progressed to brain death. Shortly after that, the team that arranged organ donation came to speak with David’s parents, and they elected to donate. They were grateful for the time they had with him and for the way they were treated. David’s father said, “No one ever misled us or told us anything but the truth…and most importantly, we were there for everything.”2 We did everything we could for David, and nothing could change his ultimate outcome. But I think that the way someone dies is incredibly important. The circumstances of how he was treated probably helped allow the family to donate David’s organs and better come to terms with his death. They later generously donated their time to help the neurocritical care unit develop the family-centered approach we wanted by participating in many discussions about their experiences. FAMILY-CENTERED UNITS POSE CHALLENGES Q Units that are designed for both patients and their families bring to the fore enormous issues that arise in the ICU daily. How does one care for patients and their families simultaneously? Our challenges have included the following, among others: Team rounding. • Nobody was happy about inviting families to rounds. Training medical students and fellows with families in the room is a real paradigm shift and raises many controversial issues. Yet I feel that the family needs to be aware of what is going on, particularly because our patients often are intubated and sedated and cannot act as their own advocates. Nursing handoffs. • Imagine a nurse operating FIGURE 1. Design of the patient/family suites in Emory University Hospital’s redesigned neurocritical care unit.

SUCCESSES AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS Q Emory’s neurosciences critical care unit won the 2008 ICU Design Citation Award from the Society of Critical Care Medicine, the American Association of Critical Care Nurses, and the American Institute of Architects Academy on Architecture for Health. We are now beginning to look at outcomes resulting from the unit redesign, and they all are going in the right direction. ICU patient satisfaction and staff satisfaction have increased, according to self-assessments. Other outcomes being assessed are length of stay and benchmark parameters of quality. We are currently piloting a staff-family simulation workshop that will train all 80 members of our ICU nursing staff, including fellows, residents, and other faculty, in the fundamentals of communication. Using a one-way mirror, a team of psychologists and experts in grief and posttraumatic stress will watch simulated conversations among staff and actors role-playing situations involving brain death, organ donation, and diagnoses involving high mortality. Although the concept of care centered around the patient and his or her family seems as acceptable as motherhood and apple pie, there is enormous resistance to it, even from the most dedicated health care workers. The process was long and laborious: we spent about a year and a half preparing for it with a familycentered team and involved all sorts of charters and directors along the way. Starting the changes is the real challenge. REFERENCES Q 1. Ulrich R, Quan X, Zimring C, Joseph A, Choudhary R.

Introduction. Dedicated neurointensivists have been shown to improve outcome measurements in the neurosciences intensive care unit (NSICU). Quality outcome data in relation to patient and family satisfaction is lacking. This study evaluated the impact of newly appointed neurointensivists and creation of a neurocritical care team on quality outcome measures including patient satisfaction in a NSICU. Methods. This is a retrospective study of data over 36 months from a 14-bed NSICU evaluating quality outcome measures and anonymous patient satisfaction questionnaires before and after neurointensivists appointment. Results. After appointment of neurointensivists, patient acuity of the NSICU increased by 33.4% while LOS decreased by 3.5%. There was a decrease in neurosciences mortality (35.8%), catheter-associated urinary tract infection (50%), central line associated bloodstream infection (100%), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (50%). During the same time, patient satisfaction increased by 28.3% on physicians/nurses consistency (𝑝= 0.025), by 69.5% in confidence/trust in physicians (𝑝< 0.0001), by 78.3% on physicians treated me with courtesy/respect (𝑝< 0.0001), and by 46.4% on physicians’ attentiveness (𝑝< 0.0001). Ultimately, patients recommending the hospital to others increased by 67.5% (𝑝< 0.0001). Conclusion. Dedicated neurointensivists and the subsequent development of a neurocritical care team positively impacted quality outcome metrics, particularly significantly improving patient satisfaction. 1. Introduction Neurointensive care is an area of medicine bridging multiple fields to provide specialized care to critically ill patients with neurological illnesses . The neurointensivist serves an important role orchestrating personnel, neurologists, neurosurgeons, consultants, therapists, pharmacists, nursing, and administration, involved in patient care in the neurosciences intensive care unit (NSICU). This orchestrater role is important for patient outcome and healthcare quality . Studies have shown that a neurointensivist managing a NSICU improves outcomes and shortens length of stays in all neurocritically ill patients and also improves documentation [5–9]. Similar improvements after dedicated neurointensivists have been demonstrated in patients with ischemic stroke [9–14], subarachnoid hemorrhage , traumatic brain injury , intracerebral hemorrhage , and neuromuscular respiratory failure . These studies, however, lack information on patient and family satisfaction concomitantly with the improvement in other clinical quality metrics. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of newly appointed neurointensivists with the subsequent development of a neurocritical care team on quality metrics including patient and family satisfaction after discharge from a NSICU at an academic, tertiary care medical center. Hindawi Critical Care Research and Practice Volume 2017, Article ID 6394105, 6 pages  2 Critical Care Research and Practice Table 1: Patient satisfaction questionnaire. Questions (1) How often were the different doctors and nurses consistent with each other in providing you information and care? (2) During this hospital stay, how often did you have confidence and trust in the doctors treating you? (3) During this hospital stay, how often did doctors treat you with courtesy and respect? (4) During this hospital stay, how often did doctors listen carefully to you? (5) Would you recommend this hospital to your friends and family? 2. Methods This was a retrospective study of anonymous patient surveys and quality metric data from a 14-bed NSICU at an academic, tertiary care center over a 36-month time period (January 2014 to January 2017). 18 months were reviewed before appointment of neurointensivists and were compared to a similar 18-month time frame after appointment of neurointensivists (CRN and PN). The Institutional Review Board approved this study. 2.1. Survey Patient Population. Quality metrics data included catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI), Foley catheter days, central line associated blood stream infection (CLABSI), central line days, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator days, patient acuity, mortality (observed : expected ratio), length of stay (LOS), and patient days. These metrics were obtained from University Health System Consortium (UHC; Irving, TX, USA), National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN; Atlanta, GA, USA), and Acuity Plus databases (Herndon, VA, USA). Anonymous survey data was obtained from patient satisfaction questionnaires after discharge from the NSICU using the National Research Council (NRC) Picker database (Lincoln, NE, USA). The Likert scale questionnaire included questions related to (1) physicians and nurses consistency; (2) confidence and trust in physicians; (3) courtesy and respect by physicians; (4) attentiveness of physicians; (5) recommending the hospital to others. The questions can be found in Table 1. Data were compared after the appointment of neurointensivists (CRN and PN) and dedicated neurocritical care team to controls from the immediate 18 months before appointment. Before the appointment of neurointensivists, the NSICU was managed as an open ICU by neurologists and neurosurgeons with the assistance of consulting medical intensivists and advanced practice providers. Not all patients required a consultation from the medical intensive care team. After the appointment of the neurointensivists and creation of the neurocritical care team, the NSICU operated as a high intensity ICU model. 2.2. Establishment of the NSICU 2.2.1. Clinical Improvement. The main focus was on clinical improvement in key areas: ICU team, coordination of care, family and patient involvement in their care, nursing involvement during rounding, and creation of checklists, protocols, and order sets. The NSICU team worked closely with the admitting service, neurology or neurosurgery, to develop thorough plans for the patients’ care. Rounding occurred at the bedside in patients’ rooms. The neurointensivist directed the rounding. Families were encouraged to participate in rounding. Nurses provided a brief overview of the patient followed by neurological examination and neurological specific data (e.g., external ventricular device setting and output, changes in examination, planned neuroimaging, sedation, and pain control) followed by other pertinent information and data (e.g., vitals, ins and outs, bowel regimen and diet, blood glucose trends, respiratory status, inflammatory/infectious status, ending with deep venous thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis, and skin concerns). Immediately following the nurse presentation, the dedicated neuropharmacist reviewed medications with the team. The resident and/or advanced practice providers then discussed the plan by organ system with the neurointensivist. This format allowed for bedside teaching of management of the neurocritically ill patient. The resident/advance practice providers’ progress note was specific to the needs of the critically ill neurosciences patient and followed the same format as the nurses rounding report. Finally, an eleven-point checklist ensured basic care of an ICU patient was completed. This checklist was based on the “ABCDEF” ICU bundle ( The rounding NSICU team consisted of nurses, advance practice providers, residents, medical students, critical care fellows rotating from other units, pharmacist, and respiratory therapist. Prior to formal rounding each morning, a multidisciplinary meeting with the neurology, neurosurgery, and NSICU teams occurred to discuss all patients in the NSICU. At this meeting, the plans of care were reviewed with social work, case management, nutrition, speech/language pathology, respiratory therapy, and physical and occupational therapy to ensure consistent disposition plan. A separate huddle also occurs with nursing prior to formal rounds to review the need for catheters, central lines, and ventilators. To ensure maintenance of quality, a weekly meeting occurred with nursing leadership of the NSICU in addition to the neurosurgery and neurology service leadership to discuss nursing and unit concerns and improvement opportunities. During these meetings, we addressed mortalities, documentation, grievances, and future plans. Additional monthly meetings with infection control reviewed VAPs, CAUTIs, mortalities, and patient safety network concerns. Protocols and order sets were created specific for the NSICU. These served as a basis for educating other members of the team as well as standardizing care delivered. 3537, 2017, 1, Downloaded from  by Cochrane France, Wiley Online Library on [17/01/2026].

Education and Research. Education of residents, nurses, medical students, and critical care fellows was emphasized. Weekly meetings were held to lecture on topics specific to NSICU, discuss journal articles, review mortality/ morbidity, discuss research opportunities, and review electroencephalograms (EEGs) from NSICU patients. 2.3. Statistics. Continuous and categorical data were summarized with descriptive statistics including means and standard deviations (continuous data) and frequencies (categorical data). Fisher’s exact test (categorical) and Student’s 𝑡-test (continuous) were used for statistical analyses. A 𝑝 ≤ 0.05 was considered significant. Data was analyzed using GraphPad Prism 7 (LaJolla, CA, USA). 3. Results 3.1. Quality Metrics. There were 4426 total patient days before appointment of dedicated neurointensivists and 4496 total patient days after appointment of dedicated neurointensivists and neurocritical care team over the 36-month study period. After the appointment, patient acuity of the NSICU increased by 3.4% (5.41 versus 7.21; 𝑝= 0.13) while LOS decreased by 3.5% (13.11 versus 12.66; 𝑝= 0.77). Neurology/neurosurgery mortality observed-to-expected ratio decreased by 35.8% (1.49 versus 0.90; 𝑝= 0.019). Absolute decreases were seen in CAUTI (50%, 𝑝= 0.41), CLABSI (100%, 𝑝= 0.51), and VAP (50%, 𝑝= 0.57). Overall, there was a significant decrease in central line days (1.5%, 𝑝< 0.0001), ventilator days (0.66%, 𝑝< 0.0001), and Foley days (18.3%, 𝑝< 0.0001; Table 2). 3.2. Patient Satisfaction. 114 questionnaires were returned. Comparing the questionnaires before and after neurointensivists (𝑛= 77, and 𝑛= 37, resp.), patient satisfaction increased by 28.3% on physicians and nurses consistency (𝑝= 0.025), by 69.5% in confidence and trust in physicians (𝑝< 0.0001), by 78.3% on courtesy and respect by the physicians (𝑝< 0.0001), and by 46.4% on physicians’ attentiveness (𝑝< 0.0001).

Discussion Dedicated neurointensivists and the creation of a neurocritical care team positively impacted quality outcome metrics including decreasing the rates of mortality, CAUTI, CLABSI, and VAP and ultimately decreasing LOS. Importantly, the appointment of neurointensivists positively impacted patient satisfaction. This study is the first to highlight improvement in patient satisfaction in addition to quality metric data after the appointment of neurointensivists. 3537, 2017, 1, Downloaded from  by Cochrane France, Wiley Online Library on [17/01/2026]. See the Terms and Conditions ( on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License 4 Critical Care Research and Practice After the appointment of neurointensivists, the acuity of the NSICU increased. Despite this increase in acuity, the mortality and length of stay decreased. Prior to the appointment of neurointensivists, higher acuity patients were admitted to the medical intensive care unit with neurology consulting. These critically ill neurosciences patients were now managed by neurointensivists in the NSICU. We hypothesized that achieving these goals of decreasing LOS and mortality was largely in part because of having specially trained neurointensivists and dedicated neurocritical care team managing the critically ill patient, establishing protocols and order sets specific to neurologically injured patients, and focusing on nursing education and engagement. The multidisciplinary approach to the patient created an open discussion with nursing and therapists about the patients. This approach possibly improved our CAUTI, CLABSI, and VAP rates likely by the reduction in our line and catheter days. The absolute numbers are small, which may overstate the significance. Ventilator days also significantly decreased by a small absolute amount (i.e., 7 ventilator days). The decrease in the observed-to-expected mortality ratio (i.e., a risk-adjusted measure of the overall mortality) can be accomplished by two methods. One is to increase the expected mortality. The other is to decrease the observed mortality. The expected mortality is calculated based on premorbid and comorbid conditions recorded in a patient population that are beyond control of the hospital. The observed mortality is the actual number of deaths. It can be argued that documentation improved with the appointment of the neurointensivists, which ultimately decreased the observed-to-expected ratio. However, prior to the appointment of the neurointensivists, the institution had standardized collection of key coding words in admission and progress notes for the expected mortality variable, which has largely remained unchanged. Overall, the decrease in the observedto-expected rate was likely a combination of improved documentation (which increased the expected mortality denominator) as well as an actual decrease in mortality (which decreased the observed mortality numerator). Our data is consistent with the retrospective study by Suarez et al. . This group showed that after the introduction of a neurointensivist and neurocritical care team, mortality and length of stay significantly decreased. They hypothesized that the driving factors of the improved outcomes were from ICU organization including staffing with physicians that were readily available to critically ill patients as well as creating a high intensity intensive care unit model . The benefits of a high intensity model have been shown by Durbin Jr. . In a high intensity model of ICU care delivery, where all orders are placed by ICU team and all patients in the ICU are seen by the ICU team, mortality decreased (OR 0.61; 95% CI 0.05–0.75) and ICU and hospital lengths of stay decreased . Durbin Jr. estimated that 30–50% fewer patients would die if an intensivist rounded daily on all critically ill patients . They hypothesized that this model allowed for more rapid intervention and prevention of potentially catastrophic events . Indeed, in the medical ICU, mortality from septic shock decreased from 74 to 57% by having an intensivist and all ICU mortality decreased from 20.9 to 14.9% . Mortality actually increased by a factor of three if there was not a daily ICU physician led round . Finally, the intensivist was defined as a person who “makes all final decisions about the care of the patients, including who is admitted and discharged, which physicians to consult, and all other aspects of care” . Barriers to work as a team are known. These include physicians and the health professionals being slow to accept change, relinquishing some autonomy to become a team member, other physicians feel loss of authority, patient control, and personal income . A well-functioning team has been shown to provide better care than a single physician dictating care from a remote site . The benefits of a critical care team extend beyond just having a dedicated intensivist. Other factors that improve patient outcomes include keeping nurse-to-patient ratio of less than 1 : 2 , having a dedicated pharmacist on rounds , and having a dedicated respiratory therapist . We have also shown that the rates of CAUTI, CLABSI, and VAPs decreased after development of a dedicated team managing the critically ill neurosciences patient. The decreased infection rate from CLABSI, CAUTI, and VAP can be cost saving based on 2016 national average data provided by the Health Services Advisory Group ( Indeed, managing neurologically injured patients in a dedicated neurocritical care unit is cost-effective compared to combined neuro/general critical care units . Patient satisfaction improved with the development of a neurocritical care team led by a neurointensivist. We have shown that patient and family satisfaction improved on physician attentiveness and consistency, confidence/trust in the physician, and treatment with respect and courtesy. Ultimately, the patients and families recommended the hospital to others. These improvements reflect the high intensity model that was created. By having an intensivist led ICU, the admitting physician (either neurology or neurosurgery) can spend more time performing surgery and/or seeing patients in clinic by being freed of the need to provide care on a minute-to-minute basis to critically ill patients . This model has been shown to be less alienating compared to a closed ICU model . The high intensity model encourages communication between the different services, which ultimately provides the best care for the patient. In the neurocritical care unit, this model has been shown to be effective . An important aspect we noticed was our rounding style. Rounding occurred at bedside, which encouraged patients and families to participate in rounds and decisions. This type of rounding style allowed for transparency in decision making. It also encouraged open communication between the families, patients, and neurocritical care team. In comparison to the other satisfaction questions, physician and nurse consistency only improved by 28.3% with the development of the neurocritical care team. We suspect this was a reflection of a high intensity model (i.e., not a closed ICU model) as well as the inherent nature of an intensive care unit. Nurses worked three 12-hour shifts that caused constant change and less continuity with care of the patient requiring a prolonged ICU stay. Nurses also rotated from other units without having the specialized foundation of neurocritical care that is necessary to communicate with families and 3537, 2017, 1, Downloaded from  by Cochrane France, Wiley Online Library on [17/01/2026]. See the Terms and Conditions ( on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License Critical Care Research and Practice 5 patients. Similarly, residents rotated on two-week blocks through the NSICU. Night-time was covered by a night-float resident who may not fully understand the details of the plan as discussed during the day. Rotating residents come from varying backgrounds - neurology, neurosurgery, emergency medicine, and family medicine. Lastly, the timing of rounds by the other services can be a source of miscommunication. The results of the patient satisfaction questionnaire and possible sources for inconsistencies have provided us with information on areas for improvement. Improvement in patient satisfaction and quality metrics have become increasingly crucial in reimbursements from payors. The restructuring of reimbursements by health insurances places specific emphasis on quality metrics and patient satisfaction . Future projects will be aimed at improving consistency in the communication with patients and families and ultimately determining the financial benefits to the hospital by the improved patient satisfaction scores. Retrospective studies have inherent limitations. A limitation of this study was that not all families/patients returned questionnaires or fully completed questionnaires. It is unclear how many questionnaires were originally mailed to patients. The questionnaires were administered by an independent agency. Thus, we cannot calculate the response rate. The questionnaires were answered after discharge from hospital; thus, answers may be biased by post-ICU care. We limited our analysis to the specific questions relating to the NSICU. We do recognize that the care patients receive after ICU can bias their overall reflection of the hospital experience. Additionally, the number of surveys returned after the appointment of the neurointensivists was less than before appointment. This discrepancy was a reflection of the growth of the ICU. The acuity of the patients in the ICU has increased since the neurointensivists were appointed. As such, many of these patients after neurointensivist appointment were discharged to a long-term acute care facility, skilled nursing facility, or acute rehabilitation center. Patients who were not discharged home were not surveyed. Lastly, we do not have data from other intensive care units during this same time period for comparison. To overcome the limitations, families were actively engaged in rounds. A nursing position was created to focus on education and research. The neurocritical care team worked with nursing and neurology/neurosurgery leadership on methods to improve consistent message to the patients/families. The messages emphasized included team discussions prior to prognosticating, open communication, and increased interface with the other services, simplifying the clinical information provided to families/patients and improving the structure of nursing and multidisciplinary huddles. In conclusion, our data is the first to show improvement in anonymous satisfaction scores from patients discharged from a NSICU in relation to other quality metrics after the implementation of a neurointensivist-led, high intensity ICU model. Our data is consistent with prior studies showing improvement in iatrogenic infections and a decrease in mortality and LOS with dedicated neurointensivists and a neurocritical care team.

       " 'Introduction A continuum of care for patients and families after critical illness, extending from the intensive care unit (ICU) to community or primary care, must become the standard of care. Transparent and public reporting of long-term ICU outcomes is fundamental for obtaining informed consent to initiate and continue ICU treatment, aligning care with patient and family values, and ensuring accountability for the high human and ﬁnancial costs of these outcomes.1 It is increasingly recognized that the consequences of critical illness also place considerable strain on the families of ICU survivors, who often bear the burden of high levels of informal care. The term Post-intensive Care Family Syndrome (PICS-F) is considered to be the family member’s response to the stress caused by the ICU admission of a loved one.2 It includes symptoms experienced by family members during there loved one’s critical illness as well as those occurring after discharge from the ICU.3 The most common symptoms of relatives of critically ill patients include difﬁculty falling asleep, anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress syndrome.4 It is now known that between 25---50% of patients who survive ICU admission will need family support for care.5 The psychological and ﬁnancial impact of caring for ICU survivors resembles that of the burden of care for a chronic illness.6 Psychological morbidity may persist for months or even years after the ICU discharge of a loved one.7,8 One of the main sources of stress is reported to be the interaction between the health care team and family members. According to the literature, the family of the critically ill patient experiences speciﬁc needs during their stay in the ICU. These ones become relevant from a more holistic view of the patient in which the family is also considered as a subject of attention and care. Numerous studies have been published on the needs of the family in the ICU; particularly those related to security and information have been described as the most important. It has been observed that there is a negative difference between the degree of importance and satisfaction in most of the needs of the family of critically ill patients.9 This highlights the importance of properly identifying the issues in the patient’s medical care to which the family member considers most important. The aim of the present study is to determine the incidence of primary caregiver burden as PICS-F in a cohort of family members of critically ill patients and to identify risk factors related to its development in both the patient and the family member. Patients and methods We design a prospective observational cohort study during 24 months, from January 2019 to January 2021. The ICU of our University Hospital has 20 beds (six for cardiovascular and fourteen for polyvalent patients) and an average of 1200 admissions per year. The study sample is composed by all the primary caregiver of patients with risk factors for development of PICS, which were the inclusion criteria stated as follows: An ICU length of stay of more than seven days and at least one of the 70 Medicina Intensiva 48 (2024) 69---76 following: more than three days of mechanical ventilation, presence of delirium or shock during admission. Delirium was deﬁned by a positive result in the CAM-ICU scale and shock as the need for vasoactive therapy. During admission to ICU the following patient variables were recorded: demographics (age, sex, weight and height, BMI, work activity), type of admission (medical or surgical), diagnosis of COVID, APACHE on admission, development of shock in ICU, days of MV, days of deep sedation, presence of delirium, presence of polyneuropathy on discharge from ICU (physical MRC) and length of stay in ICU. After discharge from ICU we recorded the destination (ward/ long-term facility) and days on hospital ward after ICU. Exclusion criteria for patients were as follows: Failure to meet inclusion criteria, failure to give consent to participate in the study, Neurological disease with signiﬁcant impairment of cognition, limiting psychiatric diseases according to DMS-IV and neurodegenerative diseases, high degree of functional and/or cognitive dependence prior to admission to the ICU. High degree of functional dependence before ICU admission was when a Barthel Index score equivalent to severe dependence. High degree of cognitive dependence was equivalent to a Pfeiffer score of moderate and severe cognitive impairment. In those patients with inability to communicate, the IQCODE scale was used. The exclusion criteria for the primary caregiver were: lack of consent to participate in the study or failure to attend the follow-up visit. The protocol for follow-up includes an assessment 3 months after discharge from the ICU in consultation. Patients were weighed and measured and asked about the presence or absence of traumatic memories of the ICU. We also recorded if they were taking sedatives or psychoactive drugs and if they had returned to their previous work. Regarding the family we recorded variables related to demographics (sex, age), relationship to the patient (Spouse, others), employment status during and after hospital stay and if they need extra help for care their family at home. We interviewed them about several items related the ICU policy on visits, possibility of communication with patient if there were no visits and type of information (face-to-face or by telephone). The scales used in the patients were Barthel, SF-12 (physical-mental), HADS, Pfeiffer, IES-6 and in the relatives the Apgar and Zarit. The Barthel index measures the person’s ability to perform ten basic activities of daily living. The SF-12 scale assesses the degree of wellbeing and ability to function both physically and mentally. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) assesses emotional distress in patients with various chronic conditions, assessing cognitive and behavioral symptoms of anxiety and depression. The Pfeiffer scale detects the existence and degree of cognitive impairment through 10 short questions. The IES-6 is a 6-question test that measures the principal components of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder. The Zarit Scale is a 22-question scale designed to assess caregiver burden, widely used in dependency studies (≤46 No strain, 47---56 Mild strain >56 Severe strain). The Family APGAR is a ﬁvequestion questionnaire that seeks to assess the functional status of the family. These last two scales are available as',\n",
       " 'Introduction The costs associated with traumatic brain injury (TBI) in Europe have been estimated at 23.7 billion USD (US$37 billion; Wittchen et al., 2011), which is a major health concern considering TBI incidence is increasing due to road traffic accidents (European Commission, n.d.). Common sequelae after brain injury include psychosocial (Cunningham, Chan, & Jones, 1999), physical (Lynch, 1986), and cognitive impairments (Malkesman, Tucker, Ozl, & McCabe, 2013), as well as neuropsychiatric symptoms (e.g., depression, anxiety, irritability; Benedictus, Spikman, & van der Naalt, 2010). These impairments often necessitate an informal caregiver, and because of the sudden nature of TBI, caregivers are often unprepared to assume this role (Sinnakaruppan & Williams, 2001). The caregivers of individuals with TBI are often uniquely challenged because of the variety of deficits that TBI patients may experience. Loss of function is typically seen in more than one domain (e.g., physical, cognitive), with the deficits impacting most areas of the patients’ and caregivers’ lives. Consequently, the role of the caregiver is complex and can range from providing daily care to navigating insurance companies and lawyers. This article was published Online First October 17, 2016.

Outcomes associated with being a TBI caregiver are well documented and include reduced quality of life (Livingston et al., 2010; Norup, Snipes, et al., 2013); poor social functioning, increased stress, and burden (Nonterah et al., 2013); and depression and anxiety (Doser & Norup, 2016; Manskow et al., 2014; Norup, Kristensen, Poulsen, Nielsen, & Mortensen, 2013; Norup, Siert, & Mortensen, 2010; Perrin et al., 2013). Caregivers’ psychosocial functioning is directly associated with the quality of care that they provide to the person with the brain injury (Vangel, Rapport, & Hanks, 2011), which suggests a need for further investigation to understand the influences on caregiver mental health. Prior research has indicated that caregivers’ lower satisfaction with life is associated with greater caregiver burden and depression (Kreutzer et al., 2009), and poor family functioning is also associated with higher caregiver strain (Gan, Campbell, Gemeinhardt, & McFadden, 2006). Specific impairments after brain injury are also associated with caregiver mental health. Cognitive and physical deficits have shown a strong association with caregiver distress (Anderson et al., 2009; Brooks, Campsie, Symington, Beattie, & McKinlay, 1987; Norup, Welling, Qvist, Siert, & Mortensen, 2012), even up to 5 years postinjury (Ponsford & Schönberger, 2010). Similarly, caregiver depression and anxiety have been associated with cognitive, behavioral, and emotional changes in individuals with brain injury (Ponsford, Olver, Ponsford, & Nelms, 2003). However, most of the findings have been reported in cross-sectional studies; few longitudinal studies have investigated mental health in caregivers over time, but those that do have suggested that symptoms of anxiety and depression decrease (Norup, Petersen, & Mortensen, 2015) and quality of life increases (Norup, Snipes, et al., 2013) during the first year after injury. One facet of care that is receiving growing, albeit limited, attention is the association between caregivers’ personality traits and their mental and physical health (Bookwala & Schulz, 1998; Hooker, Monahan, Shifren, & Hutchinson, 1992; Kim, Duberstein, Sörensen, & Larson, 2005; Löckenhoff, Duberstein, Friedman, & Costa, 2011). TBI caregivers are typically not prepared for their caregiving role because of the sudden onset of TBI, and consequently many caregivers may draw on preexisting psychosocial characteristics such as personality traits in order to adjust to the novel demands of their new role (McClendon & Smyth, 2013). One of the more common conceptualizations of personality structure uses a five-factor model (Goldberg, 1990). In this model, personality can largely be described as consisting of five dimensions: neuroticism (tendency to experience negative emotions), extraversion (sociability, excitability, and tendency to experience positive emotions), openness to experience (appreciation for a variety of experiences), conscientiousness (self-discipline and organization), and agreeableness (altruism and willingness to cooperate with others; McCrae & Costa, 1987). Research on caregivers of individuals with other types of conditions such as dementia, stroke, and cancer has reported that caregivers high in neuroticism have been shown to have more depression (Gallant & Connell, 2003), greater caregiver burden and distress (Markiewicz, Reis, & Gold, 1997), increased sensitivity to caregiver-related stressors (Bookwala & Schulz, 1998), dysfunctional coping strategies (Hooker, Frazier, & Monahan, 1994), and worse subjective mental health (Hooker et al., 1992). Caregivers high in extraversion display less depression (Kim et al., 2005), lower burden and strain (Gallant & Connell, 2003), more adaptive coping strategies (Hooker et al., 1994), and better mental and physical health (Hooker et al., 1992). Similarly, caregivers high in conscientiousness report greater adaptive coping strategies (Hooker et al., 1994), more benefit-finding in the caregiving experience (Hollis-Sawyer, 2003), and lower sensitivity to caregiverrelated stressors (Koerner & Kenyon, 2007). And finally, caregivers with high agreeableness report less maladaptive coping strategies (Hooker et al., 1994) and more benefit-finding (Koerner, Kenyon, & Shirai, 2009), whereas those higher on openness to experience tend to experience positive perceptions of the caregiving experience (Hollis-Sawyer, 2003). Most research on caregiver mental health within the field of brain injury has investigated the potential influence of impairments in the individual with TBI (Nonterah et al., 2013; Norup et al., 2010), as well as external factors such as social support (Stevens et al., 2013). However, no research has examined the relationship between personality traits and mental health outcomes among caregivers of persons with brain injury using cross-sectional or longitudinal methods. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to use hierarchal linear modeling to examine whether Danish caregivers’ personality traits were predictive of their trajectories of mental health-related quality of life (HRQoL), anxiety, and depression beginning at the patients’ stay in a neurointensive care unit through 1 year after injury. It was hypothesized that symptoms of anxiety and depression would decrease and health-related quality of life would increase during the first year after injury. Furthermore, it was expected that higher levels of neuroticism would be associated with more prolonged trajectories of anxiety and depression. Method Participants Participants were 52 family members of patients with severe brain injury admitted for intensive neurorehabilitation in Denmark at the Clinic of Neurorehabilitation, Traumatic Brain Injury Unit, Rigshospitalet. All family members consented to participate in the Clinic of Neurorehabilitation, Traumatic Brain Injury Unit study. If more than one family member was present at enrollment, the family decided which family member should participate. Inclusion criteria were that participants had to be (a) at least 18 years old, (b) Danish speaking, and (c) without a current psychiatric diagnosis or progressive brain disease (e.g., dementia). Family members had a mean age of 49.44 years (SD \\x02 12.78). Additional demographic information appears in Table 1. All patients had been admitted to intensive neurorehabilitation and had severe brain injury (TBI or nontraumatic brain injury [NTBI]) as indicated by a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS; Teasdale & Jennett, 1974) score between 3 and 9. Patients with a GCS above 9 were included only if their injury included severe focal neurological deficits such as aphasia, agitation, or hemiparesis. All patients had completed neurosurgery (if applicable) and were respiratorily stable. The mean age of patients was 40.97 years (SD \\x02 19.38).

The SF-36 (Stewart & Ware, 1992) is a widely used self-report measure of health-related quality of life (HRQoL). This 36-item measure has been used in both individuals with TBI (Guilfoyle et al., 2010) and in TBI caregivers (ArangoLasprilla et al., 2011; McPherson, Pentland, & McNaughton, 2000). Only four subscales focusing on caregivers’ psychosocial functioning were used for the purpose of this study: Vitality, Social Functioning, Role Limitations–Emotional (performance of role as affected by emotional factors), and Mental Health. Subscale scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better HRQoL. Scores were evaluated in terms of Danish norms on the basis of gender (Bjorner, Damsgaard, Watt, & Bech, 1997). Symptom Checklist-90–Revised (SCL-90-R). The SCL90-R (Derogatis, 1994) is a 90-item self-report inventory used to assess psychological distress. Only the depression and anxiety subscales were used for this study, and higher scores indicate greater symptom severity. The scales have been validated in Danish, and a population study revealed high alpha coefficients on the depression and anxiety scales (\\x03 \\x02 .91 and \\x03 \\x02 .86, respectively; Olsen, Mortensen, & Bech, 2006). Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). The GCS assesses the degree of consciousness in individuals with brain injury (Teasdale & Jennett, 1974). Assessment factors include eye movement, motor ability, and verbal comprehension. Together these factors provide a total score of responsiveness and range from 3 (not conscious, indicative of severe brain injury) to 15 (full consciousness). Scores on the GCS were assessed at admission to early intensive rehabilitation. NEO Personality Inventory Revised (NEO-PI-R). The NEO-PI-R is an empirically derived 240-item self-report measure of five major domains of adult personality (Costa & McCrae, 1992). The five traits and their corresponding facets (in parentheses) include neuroticism (anxiety, anger hostility, depression, self-consciousness, impulsiveness, vulnerability), extraversion (warmth, gregariousness, assertiveness, activity, excitement seeking, positive emotions), openness (fantasy, aesthetics, feelings, actions, ideas, values), agreeableness (trust, straightforwardness, altruism, compliance, modesty, tender-mindedness), and conscientiousness (competence, order, dutifulness, achievement striving, self-discipline, deliberation). Internal consistency of the Danish version across domains has ranged from .86 to .91 (Costa & McCrae, 2004). The NEOPI-R was completed by all participants 3 months after the patients’ discharge from rehabilitation in order to reduce the chances that coping with a family member’s acute brain injury would cause dramatic changes in participants’ scores on this measure. Procedure Participants completed the outcome measures, the SF-36, and the anxiety and depression subscales from the SCL-90-R across five waves. Time points included while the person with brain injury was (a) in the neurointensive care unit, (b) at admission to early intensive rehabilitation, (c) at discharge from rehabilitation, (d) at 3 months postdischarge, and (e) at 1 year postinjury. Caregivers completed the NEO-PI-R assessment at 3 months postdischarge. About half of the sample provided data in the neurointensive care unit, in part due to the chaotic nature of this time period, with many families and caregivers being unavailable, limiting the ability to substantively recruit participants at this time point. The Danish Data Protection Agency (2007-41-0583) and the Committees on Biomedical Research Ethics of the Capital Region of Denmark (S-KF-311150) provided study approval. All patients gave their informed consent according to the Helsinki Declaration. Data Analyses Six separate hierarchical linear models (HLMs) were performed to predict family members’ four mental HRQoL SF-36, anxiety, and depression scores across 1 year after the patient’s injury (see Table 2). All six models included time and the five NEO personality subscale scores as predictors, with the personality scores treated as continuous variables. Time and the NEO scores were all centered and entered simultaneously as fixed effects into each HLM. The four subscales of the HRQoL (Vitality, Social Functioning, Role Limitations–Emotional, Mental Health), as well as anxiety and depression scores, were examined separately as outcome variables. Intercepts but not slopes were included as random effects in all models, and within-subject residuals were treated as independent. Data collected at baseline (neurointensive care unit) were coded as 0, with each sequential follow-up coded in numerical order—admission to rehabilitation as 1; discharge from rehaTable 1 Characteristics of Patients With Brain Injury and Their Family Members Variable n (%) M \\x04 SD Range Family members (n \\x02 52) Gender Female 41 (78.8) Male 11 (21.2) Relationship Spouse 18 (34.6) Parent 22 (42.3) Children 6 (11.5) Siblings 2 (3.8) Boy- or girlfriend 2 (3.8) Others 2 (3.8) Occupational status Full-time work 45 (86.5) Pension 5 (9.6) Unknown 2 (3.8) Cohabitant status: Cohabiting with the patient 31 (59.6) Patients (n \\x02 52) Gender Female 15 (28.8) Male 37 (71.2) Injury Traumatic 39 (75.0) Nontraumatic 13 (25.0) Infarction 5 (9.6) Cardiac arrest 2 (3.8) Subarachnoid hemorrhage 3 (5.8) Tumor 2 (3.8) Spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage 1 (1.9) GCS 11.34 \\x04 3.08 5–15 LOS 111.44 \\x04 50.32 12–210 Note.

Because of substantial individual variability in the time intervals between assessments, we coded time with equally spaced integers from 0 to 4. The analyses therefore reflect difference across waves of data collection but do not necessarily reflect actual time spacing between waves. After each of the six primary HLMs, follow-up HLMs were run to examine whether any of the statistically significant fixed effects in the first models interacted significantly with time in the prediction of the outcome variable, which would indicate that the trajectories of the outcome changed differentially over time as a function of one of the NEO-PI-R personality subscales. As in the first set of analyses, only intercepts were included as random effects in all models, and within-subject residuals were treated as independent. All HLM analyses utilized the maximum-likelihood estimation method and were conducted using SPSS Version 22.0. Varianceexplained effect sizes (similar to the R2 in ordinary least squares regression for within-subject or repeated-measure level) proposed by Snijders and Bosker (1994) were computed for each model. This effect size is commonly reported in research with linear growth models (Snijders & Bosker, 1994). Results The sample consisted of caregivers for both TBI and NTBI patients, because both patient groups receive the same treatment and rehabilitation in the unit. No significant differences associated with etiology of the injury were found in relation to caregiver outcomes, and consequently, data were treated as being homogenous. All parameters estimates are unstandardized and should be interpreted within the context of the scale from which the predictor variable is derived. Vitality In the first HLM, with vitality as the dependent variable, time was a statistically significant predictor (b \\x02 5.50, SE \\x02 .83, p \\x05 .001), such that vitality scores improved across all five time points. Neuroticism (b \\x02 \\x06.33, SE \\x02 .12, p \\x02 .010) and conscientiousness (b \\x02 \\x06.40, SE \\x02 .17, p \\x02 .020) were also significant predictors, indicating that caregivers who were less neurotic and less conscientious had higher vitality over time. The total withinvariance accounted for by this model was 21.4%. In order to examine whether any of the statistically significant fixed effects in the first HLM interacted with time in the prediction of the caregivers’ vitality trajectories, we ran a follow-up HLM. In this model, neuroticism and conscientiousness, along with time and the interaction terms between time and each variable, were added. None of the interaction terms were statistically significant in the HLM (all ps \\x02 .278), suggesting that the slopes of caregivers’ vitality trajectories did not differ as a function of either neuroticism or conscientiousness. Social Functioning In the second HLM, with social functioning as the dependent variable, time was statistically significant (b \\x02 7.66, SE \\x02 1.07, p \\x05 .001), such that across the five time points social functioning improved. Neuroticism (b \\x02 \\x06.34, SE \\x02 .15, p \\x02 .032) and conscientiousness (b \\x02 \\x06.52, SE \\x02 .21, p \\x02 .016) were also significant predictors, such that participants who were less neurotic and less conscientious had greater social functioning over time. Agreeableness also statistically predicted social functioning (b \\x02 .50, SE \\x02 .21, p \\x02 .021), indicating that caregivers who were more agreeable had greater social functioning over time. The withinvariance accounted for by this model was 24.7%. As before, a follow-up HLM was run in which the fixed effects were neuroticism, conscientiousness, and agreeableness, along with time and the interaction terms between time and each of these variables. None of the interaction terms was statistically significant (all ps \\x02 .103). Role Limitations–Emotional In the third HLM, with role limitations–emotional as the dependent variable, time was the only statistically significant predictor (b \\x02 10.38, SE \\x02 1.69, p \\x05 .001), such that role limitations due to emotional functioning improved across the five time points. All NEO predictors were nonsignificant (all ps \\x02 .067). The withinvariance accounted for by this model was 20.1%. Mental Health In the fourth HLM, with mental health as the dependent variable, time was significant (b \\x02 11.09, SE \\x02 .87, p \\x05 .001), such that mental health scores improved over time. Neuroticism (b \\x02 \\x06.37, SE \\x02 .09, p \\x05 .001) and conscientiousness (b \\x02 \\x06.36, SE \\x02 .13, p \\x02 .007) were also significant predictors, indicating that less neurotic and less conscientious caregivers had better mental health over time. The within-variance accounted for was 50.5% in this model. A follow-up HLM was run in which the fixed effects were neuroticism and conscientiousness, along with time and the interaction terms between time and each of these variables. None of the interactions was statistically significant (all ps \\x02 .146).

Neuroticism was also statistically significant (b \\x02 .11, SE \\x02 .05, p \\x02 .034), such that participants who were more neurotic had greater levels of anxiety over time. All other predictors were nonsignificant (all ps \\x07 .465). The explained within-variance accounted for by this model was 19.4%. As before, a follow-up HLM was performed with neuroticism as the fixed effect, along with time and the interaction of both variables The interaction of time with neuroticism was statistically significant (b \\x02 .07, SE \\x02 .02, p \\x05 .001), suggesting that although all individuals decreased in anxiety over time, there was a larger decline in symptoms of anxiety among caregivers with low levels of neuroticism (see Figure 1). This figure and Figure 2 are graphical representations of the model-based predicted values. Depression In the sixth HLM, with depression as the dependent variable, time was statistically significant (b \\x02 \\x061.92, SE \\x02 .39, p \\x05 .001), suggesting that symptoms of depression improved over time. Neuroticism was also a statistically significant predictor (b \\x02 .14, SE \\x02 .05, p \\x02 .006), indicating that caregivers who were more neurotic had greater levels of depression over time. The remaining predictors were not statistically significant (all ps \\x07 .333). The within-variance accounted for by this model was 14.1%. Similar to the case in prior analyses, a follow-up HLM was conducted with neuroticism and time as the fixed effects, along with the interaction term of the two. The interaction term was statistically significant (b \\x02 .04, SE \\x02 .02, p \\x02 .014), suggesting that depression improved at a quicker rate over time in caregivers with low levels of neuroticism than in those with high neuroticism (see Figure 2). Discussion The purpose of the current study was to construct linear growth models to examine whether personality traits of Danish caregivers of persons with severe brain injury were predictive of caregivers’ trajectories of mental HRQoL, anxiety, and depression beginning at patients’ stay in a neurointensive care unit through 1 year after injury. All four HRQoL, anxiety, and depression variables improved significantly across the five time points. Caregivers who were less neurotic and less conscientious tended to have higher scores on measures of vitality, social functioning, and mental health over time. Additionally, caregivers with higher agreeableness had higher social functioning. Although the overall sample experienced a decrease in anxiety and depression over time, caregivers with low neuroticism decreased more quickly in both depression and anxiety. Most research on caregivers within the field of TBI has investigated how patients’ different characteristics predict caregivers’ emotional state (Anderson et al., 2009; Brooks et al., 1987; Ponsford et al., 2003; Ponsford & Schönberger, 2010), but no research has investigated how caregivers’ personality traits are associated with psychological adjustment to their family member’s condition. Related research has been performed on coping styles (Calvete & de Arroyabe, 2012; Carnes & Quinn, 2005; Norup, Siert, & Mortensen, 2013) and resilience (Simpson & Jones, 2013) in caregivers, where both constructs have been found to correlate positively with positive affect (Simpson & Jones, 2013) and HRQoL (Norup, Siert, et al., 2013) and negatively with burden (Simpson & Jones, 2013). However, no study has investigated personality traits in TBI caregivers, especially in terms of their longitudinal associations, and thus the results of the current study are novel. Nevertheless, these findings are comparable to research focused on other neurological conditions such as dementia and stroke. Within the field of dementia research, Markiewicz and colleagues (1997) reported that caregivers with higher neuroticism experience more burden and distress, and in concordance with this finding, Gallant and Connell (2003) found that dementia caregivers with high neuroticism showed more negative emotional states and depression. Melo, Maroco, and de Mendonça (2011) also found that high neuroticism was a strong predictor of depression in dementia caregiver, and that, in contrast, extraversion and agreeableness were associated with decreases in both caregiver depression and burden. A similar finding was reported in stroke research, where caregivers with high neuroticism reported higher levels of Figure 1. Trajectories of anxiety by caregiver neuroticism.

Across different neurological conditions, and especially in the current study, there is evidence of neuroticism being an important personality trait in relation to coping with the adverse demands of a caregiver, with some indication that this trait is an indicator of how the individual experiences negative events. According to McCrae and Costa (2003), individuals high in neuroticism are prone to negative emotions that interfere with their ability to deal with problems. The literature well describes how being a caregiver is a time-consuming and physically and mentally draining task, and it is therefore easily imaginable how an irritable and hostile caregiver can find it hard to adapt to a chronically stressful situation. Caregivers high in neuroticism may also be prone to worry and dwell on what might go wrong (McCrae & Costa, 2003) instead of trying to deal with a distressing and demanding situation. In light of the current findings, neuroticism does seem to be related to how caregivers cope with the demands of brain injury and their own negative emotions. Caregivers high in neuroticism may be at risk of social isolation and depression over time, even as rehabilitation ends and patient impairments become more chronic. The study also found that caregivers who were less conscientious tended to have higher levels of vitality, social functioning, and mental health over time. The personality trait of conscientiousness is defined by planfulness, organization, and diligence, which theoretically could protect the caregivers from feeling overwhelmed and burdened. One reason for this contrasting finding may be that caregivers who are more conscientious might feel helpless and a lack of control at the beginning of the recovery process, especially if they thrive best with order and planning. Many issues related to the patient are not in the hands of caregivers in the early stages of recovery. Consequently, highly conscientious caregivers may be anxious in anticipation of how to care for the individual with TBI early in the recovery process extending into the first year postinjury, which may lead to poorer well-being. Despite the novelty of the current findings in the context of brain injury, they are comparable with results from other fields in neurology, with certain personality traits being robust predictors of caregiver outcomes. An important point to consider may be that different personality traits could be more important in different time periods. In the early stages of recovery from the event, characteristics related to the patients’ condition are important (Anderson et al., 2009; Brooks et al., 1987; Norup et al., 2012); however, these associations might disappear with time, suggesting that personality traits of caregivers might be especially important later in recovery. Nonetheless, it is important not to view personality traits as an obstacle to providing interventions to families dealing with brain injury. The results of this study underscore the necessity of assessing caregiver personality in an effort to tailor family interventions. Consequently, future intervention programs will benefit from including brief personality measures and possibly an assessment of coping strategies or caregiver style in order to strengthen the adaptation process of caregivers and the rest of the family. Study Limitations Limitations of this study must be considered when interpreting the results. The study included caregivers of patients with TBI and NTBI because both patient groups were treated and received rehabilitation in the clinical ward. However, no group differences were found in relation to the six different outcome variables, and consequently data were treated as being homogenous. The singlecenter design is also a limitation, which warrants caution with respect to generalizing the results. However, because the Clinic of Neurorehabilitation, Traumatic Brain Injury Unit covers the eastern part of Denmark, that fact does expand the representativeness of the sample. Data on caregiver self-reported physical health, which may have had an effect on caregiver mental health and personality, were not assessed at each time point; this would be a ripe area for future research. Additionally, the limited sample size may have affected the power of the analyses and the accuracy of the parameter estimates. Results should therefore be interpreted with an appropriate degree of caution. Finally, caregivers’ personFigure 2. Trajectories of depression by caregiver neuroticism.

Conclusion The results of this study emphasize the importance of including a personality measure when assessing burden and distress in caregivers and, even more important, when planning intervention programs for caregivers. The personality of the caregiver can be viewed as a resource and could be assessed and incorporated when providing interventions. So far, limited research has been conducted on different caregiver intervention programs within the field of ABI. Individualized intervention programs taking into account the acquired brain injury personality of the caregiver might be more beneficial and efficient. Such programs should attempt to hone more adaptive coping strategies in caregivers, which might enhance caregiver outcomes.',\n",
       " 'Introduction Families of critically ill adult patients with severe acute brain injury have to make difficult decisions regarding ICU care because their loved ones are nearly always *Correspondence: david.hwang@yale.edu †Urs Weber, Qiang Zhang have contributed equally to this work. 2 Yale New Haven Hospital, New Haven, CT, USA Full list of author information is available at the end of the article 715 incapacitated and are often faced with challenging prognoses regarding functional outcome . Meeting the decision support needs of these families is a professional and moral duty of any ICU, whether a dedicated neuroscience ICU (neuro-ICU) or a general critical care unit . However, studies of family perception of support during shared decision-making in ICUs show significant room for involvement . Only 41% of family members in one prominent general multicenter ICU study reported excellent overall satisfaction with decision-making . Understanding patient and family factors associated with family dissatisfaction with ICU shared decisionmaking support may help identify high-risk families and provide insight into high-yield strategies for effective future interventions . In the general critical care literature, several well-designed randomized trials of interventions aimed at improving ICU decisionmaking support—with broad inclusion criteria for enrolling families—have shown that demonstrating the impact of any intervention can be challenging, regardless of selected outcomes [8–10]. Although specific predictors of family dissatisfaction with critical care in general have been previously reported (e.g., living in the same city as the hospital, living in a different household than the patient) , studies of factors that specifically predict family dissatisfaction with decision-making support for neurocritically ill patients have been relatively limited . Identifying risk factors associated with dissatisfaction with shared decision-making for families of neurocritical care patients is critical to optimally assist them with making challenging decisions on behalf of their loved ones. Here we tested whether there are distinct patientlevel and family-level characteristics that predict dissatisfaction with support during neurocritical care shared decision-making, with hopes that results could guide future high-yield initiatives to improve family satisfaction with decision support. Methods Study Design, Including Ethics Statement We conducted a retrospective observational cohort study using a combined database of Family Satisfaction in the ICU 24 (FS-ICU 24) surveys collected from the neuro-ICUs at two US academic medical centers over the past decade . The institutional review boards of both medical centers separately approved the original collection of survey data and patient and family information. Analyses for this study were performed with deidentified patient and family data. Database Descriptions The Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) neuroICU FS-ICU 24 database contains data from 76 family members that were collected from July to August 2011. Families of all patients admitted to the neuro-ICU with a minimum ICU length of stay (LOS) of 24 h were approached in person at the time of or up to 48 h after ICU discharge or transfer and asked to complete paper surveys. One family member per patient was recruited, with a focus on health care proxies. Minors, non-English speakers, and all families of patients who received comfort measures only (CMO) were excluded. The capture rate of eligible participants in this database has been previously reported as 63% . The Yale New Haven Hospital (hereinafter “Yale”) neuro-ICU FS-ICU 24 database contains data from 288 family members that were collected from March to December 2015. Families of patients admitted to the neuro-ICU for longer than 72 h were eligible, with one family member per patient recruited. Minors and nonEnglish speakers were excluded. Families of patients who did not receive CMO were approached in person at the time of or up to 48 h after ICU discharge or transfer, whereas families of patients who received CMO were contacted by mail 1 month after ICU discharge to respect the time to cope with a loved one’s death and minimize recall bias . In-house surveys were conducted via an online form, and mailed surveys were completed on paper. The capture rate of eligible participants in this database has been previously reported as 49.3% (51.9% for families of patients who did not receive CMO and 40.4% for families of patients who did receive CMO) . Settings Both the MGH and Yale neuro-ICUs operate as closedcollaborative units. For neurology patients, intensivists are the primary attendings of record. For neurosurgical patients, neurosurgeons remain the primary attendings of record, but intensivists see all patients in the unit and are responsible for all orders and day-to-day management. Family meetings are also scheduled on an ad hoc basis to provide updates and discuss management of care. Some of the meetings are informal, and others are more formal, with representatives from multiple services, including nursing, social work, and case management. In both neuro-ICUs, multidisciplinary morning rounds are led by the attending intensivist at the patient’s bedside and include all patients within the unit. Prior to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, when the data for our study was conducted, families were invited to participate actively in these morning rounds. 716 Variables We divided covariates into three categories: (1) family characteristics at the time of hospital admission, (2) patient characteristics at the time of hospital admission, and (3) patient and family factors determined during the ICU course. Family covariates in both databases were captured directly from surveys, whereas patient covariates were abstracted from medical records. Family characteristics at the time of hospital admission included age, sex, race, level of education, English as a first language, relationship with patient, prior ICU experience, health care proxy status (self-identified), and size of family. Information regarding whether the family member lived with the patient and whether the family member lived in the same town as the hospital was also obtained. The demographic questions for the family survey at both sites, including those with multiple-choice answers, are listed in Supplementary Digital Content 1. Collected patient characteristics at the time of hospital admission included age, sex, race, and primary diagnosis. Patient and family factors determined during the ICU course included average hours per day spent by the family at bedside, number of formal family meetings the family reported participating in during the ICU admission (definition of “formal family meeting” was left to the judgment of the survey respondent), decision made by the family to limit code status (limitation defined as do not resuscitate, do not intubate, do not resuscitate/do not intubate, or CMO), patient LOS, and patient modified Rankin Scale at the time of discharge from the ICU. We included the modified Rankin Scale at discharge because we were concerned over the possibility that a patient’s final functional outcome could be associated with the outcome of interest. Outcome The primary outcome was family dissatisfaction with item eight on the “Satisfaction with Decision-Making” section of the FS-ICU 24 questionnaire. The FS-ICU 24 survey has been extensively validated and used to study family satisfaction in the ICU setting around the world [4, 6, 13, 15–21]. It is a 24-item survey consisting of two subsections: “Satisfaction With Care” (14 items) and “Satisfaction With Decision-Making” (10 items). Items from the latter subsection have been used extensively in studies measuring satisfaction with ICU decision-making . Item eight of the decision-making section reads, “Did you feel supported during the decision-making process?” and prompts respondents to indicate their satisfaction with the support provided on a Likert scale (five-point ranking scale; Supplementary Digital Content 2). We selected this single item as our outcome of interest as opposed to a composite score of the decisionmaking subsection of the questionnaire because this subsection itself has a wide variety of questions, each of which may be influenced by different sets of covariates in clinical practice. For this study, we defined dissatisfaction with decision-making support as less than complete satisfaction on this particular survey item, including all the options other than the top-box response. We chose this approach to mirror that way in which the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services report patient satisfaction data . Statistical Analysis We analyzed the covariates of dissatisfied and completely satisfied families and their corresponding patients using standard descriptive statistics and collapsed several levels of variables included in the original questionnaires on the basis of the relatively smaller percentages of responses received for certain levels. We then compared family and patient covariates between dissatisfied and completely satisfied families using the χ2 test for categorical variables and the Mann–Whitney U test for continuous variables. We then performed a multivariate logistic regression analysis to identify independent predictors of decisionmaking support dissatisfaction among all family covariates and among family and patient covariates combined. IBM SPSS Statistics 26 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY) was used for the analysis. Missing data were excluded . Results Subjects Selected from Databases On the basis of those participants in the data sets who had responses recorded for FS-ICU 24 item eight (“Did you feel supported during the decision-making process?”), we included 73 of the 76 respondents in the existing MGH database and 282 of the 288 respondents in the existing Yale database (355 of 364 total respondents). The overall characteristics of patients and families in the MGH and Yale data sets have been reported in prior publications . We found that 50.7% (180 of 355) of all survey respondents indicated dissatisfaction with support during decision-making: 56.1% (41 of 73) at MGH and 49.3% (139 of 282) at Yale (p\\u2009=\\u20090.30). Family Characteristics at the Time of ICU Admission Overall, family survey respondents included in the analysis were predominantly White (291 of 337 completed question responses [86.4%]) and received a college education or higher (245 of 339 [72.3%]). The majority had prior ICU experience (197 of 352 [56.0%]). Table 1 reports a univariate comparison of family characteristics ascertainable at the time of ICU admission between those who were dissatisfied with shared 717 decision-making support and those who were completely satisfied. The cohort of family respondents who were dissatisfied had smaller-sized families (e.g., “Size of family visiting patient regularly in ICU\\u2009>\\u20096 people,” 14.5% vs. 24.3%; p\\u2009=\\u20090.03). Other covariates did not significantly differ between dissatisfied and completely satisfied family members. Patient Characteristics at the Time of ICU Admission The majority of patients whose families were included in the analysis were admitted with nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (21.1%), intraparenchymal and/or intraventricular brain hemorrhage (18.9%), or ischemic stroke (18.0%). Table 2 reports a univariate comparison of patient characteristics ascertainable at the time of ICU admission between those who had family members who were dissatisfied with decision-making support and those who had family members who were completely satisfied. There were no significant differences in the recorded patient characteristics between those whose family members were dissatisfied and those whose family members were satisfied. Patient and Family Factors Determined During the ICU Course Overall, the majority of family respondents included in the analysis reported spending more than 3 h a day at the patient’s bedside (272 of 341 [79.8%]). We found that 18.9% (67 of 354) of families made a decision to limit patient code status during the ICU admission; among the Yale surrogates, 16.7% (47 of 282) requested CMO for their relatives. The average LOS for patients was 8.6 (standard deviation 8.4) days, and 32.1% (113 of 352) of patients were bedridden or dead at the time of discharge. Table 3 reports univariate comparisons of both family and patient factors determined during the ICU course between dissatisfied and completely satisfied families.

Of dissatisfied families, 15.6% made decisions to limit patient code status, compared with 22.3% of satisfied families (p\\u2009=\\u20090.11). Multivariate Analysis of Family Predictors of Decision‑Making Support Dissatisfaction Table 4 contains the results of a multivariate logistic regression analysis of family characteristics predicting dissatisfaction with decision-making support. None of the family characteristics ascertainable at the time of ICU admission were predictive of dissatisfaction, including family size. Among family factors determined during the ICU course, experiencing three or fewer formal family meetings (odds ratio 1.93 [confidence interval 1.13–3.31]; p\\u2009=\\u20090.01) was a significant predictor of family dissatisfaction with support during shared decision-making. There was also a trend toward a family’s decision to keep a patient as full code, without treatment limitations, being predictive of dissatisfaction (odds ratio 1.80 [confidence interval 0.93–3.51]; p\\u2009=\\u20090.08). A multivariate regression that included patient characteristics in addition to family characteristics did not change the results of the analysis. Discussion In this retrospective observational cohort study of a database of FS-ICU 24 surveys from two academic neuro-ICUs over the past decade, we were unable to confirm any specific characteristics of families or patients ascertainable on ICU admission that reliably predicted family dissatisfaction with shared decisionmaking support at the time of ICU discharge.

A retrospective analysis of survey responses from 457 family members of patients admitted to general ICUs in two hospitals did previously report that participating in at least one family meeting predicted satisfaction with overall decision-making processes (i.e., the composite score of ten items related to decision-making on the FS-ICU 24 survey) . Approximately 60% of patients in this analysis had an ICU LOS of less than 4 full days. Our data suggest that in neurocritical care environments, for those patients with longer LOS on average, the actual frequency of formal family meetings may be critical, specifically regarding the satisfaction with support provided during shared decision-making (i.e., a specific single item within the FS-ICU 24 survey). Another recent study of 48 surrogates of patients with nontraumatic intracerebral hemorrhage examined predictors of higher family satisfaction with overall ICU decision-making (i.e., again, the ten-item composite FS-ICU 24 decision-making subscore) and concluded that among other factors, younger patient age and the respondent being the spouse of the patient were independent predictive factors . Our larger cohort of patients with a wider array of neurocritical care diagnoses did not replicate these findings, but, again, our study used a single specific FS-ICU 24 item regarding support provided during shared decision-making as the outcome of interest. The finding in our study that a higher proportion of euro-ICU families who chose to keep patients full code trended toward reporting dissatisfaction with decisional support compared with those who decided on treatment limitations does complement prior general critical care family satisfaction literature . Family members whose loved ones passed away during ICU admission report higher levels of overall satisfaction with ICU care than those whose loved ones survived . Although our study cannot prove causation, we speculate that this correlation could be in part a by-product of increased amount of attention devoted to families of patients given do-not-intubate/do-not-resuscitate orders or CMO. This study had limitations. Nonresponse bias is a concern for survey studies; to minimize this bias, we drew data from two previously published data sets with good response rates for survey research . The response rates for these previous data sets were achieved by attempting to survey families in person while patients were still admitted to the hospital and calling those families who received mailed surveys to make them more aware of the survey request. Also, there were differences in participant inclusion/exclusion criteria between the two data sets that were combined, including the exclusion of families of patients who received CMO at MGH. Regarding concerns of differences in response rates and inclusion/exclusion at our two centers, we note that the percentage of families reporting they were dissatisfied with decision-making was similar in each cohort. We did not capture family levels of psychological distress and coping resources as predictor variables. The phrase “formal family meeting” was not explicitly defined and could therefore have been interpreted differently by different respondents. Additionally, we did not include initial disease-specific severity scores or data regarding urgent procedures for patients because of the heterogeneity of our patient population; however, we did not find any differences in dissatisfaction among families with respect to patient functional outcome at the time of ICU discharge. The databases that we used did not include information about whether individual patients were incapacitated during their neuro-ICU admissions or not, raising the question of whether their surrogates were actually required to make critical decisions on their behalf while they were admitted. Of note, although we recognize the heterogeneous makeup of neuro-ICU populations in different settings, prior literature does suggest high rates of patients who lack capacity in ICUs in general . For our outcome, we used a single item on an older version of the FS-ICU 24 survey. However, a newly revised version has now been recently developed . The exact wording of the question regarding decision-making support that we used as our outcome of interest is slightly different in the newest version of the FS-ICU 24 survey; in the newest version, respondents are now asked if they felt “unsupported,” as opposed to “overwhelmed.” It is possible that repeating the study with the new FSICU 24 item wording could lead to different results. The decision to dichotomize our selected survey question’s Likert responses into “completely satisfied” and “less satisfied,” as opposed to considering each individual level of satisfaction, was made to make the data more readily interpretable. Although this approach risks missing some more nuanced differences within the “less satisfied” group, as noted earlier, it closely mirrors the standard way in which the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services report patient satisfaction data . Of note, the databases we used do not include specific data on the exact decisions that families were asked to make during patient admissions (e.g., consent for surgery, goals of care, etc.), nor do they quantify the number of decisions made during each admission. Although we did not collect this detailed information, the “Satisfaction With Decision-Making” subsection of the FS-ICU 24 survey is validated as a tool to measure families’ overall impressions with aspects of decision-making in the ICU at or following the time of ICU discharge, as opposed to 721 immediately after individual moments during an ICU admission. Although our intention in this study was to focus on perceptions of decision-making support among surrogates of neuro-critically ill patients—given the difficult decisions that many of these surrogates have to grapple with when their incapacitated relatives are projected to have long-term disability—the fact that this study recruited only in neuro-ICUs may limit its generalizability to other areas of critical care. Additionally, findings from a pre-COVID-19 database may be difficult to generalize to an era with visitor restriction policies . Conclusions We found that family dissatisfaction with neuro-ICU shared decision-making support was not correlated with any patient or family characteristics ascertainable on ICU admission. However, among our cohort with an average LOS of 8.6 days, family dissatisfaction correlated with participating in three or fewer formal family meetings during ICU admission, and there was a nonsignificant trend of higher dissatisfaction levels among families of patients who were kept full code. Designing interventions that improve the decisionmaking experience of ICU families has proven to be a challenging task [8–10]. To optimize future trials of interventions for improving decisional support among neuro-ICU families, understanding factors that may be predictive of family dissatisfaction with support could, in theory, be important for study design and participant selection. However, our study suggests that such studies should cast a broad net regarding surrogates of patients with brain injury who are selected for study enrollment because we were unable to identify reliable covariate predictors of dissatisfaction with decision-making support. Our study does support the idea that, when designing neuro-ICU interventions to improve families’ perception of decision-making support, those strategies that promote a family’s perception of a high frequency of family meetings during the ICU admission may have a solid theoretical foundation. However, in the COVID-19 era of strict visitor restrictions, whether an association exists between frequent virtual meetings over the phone or via video-conferencing technology and family satisfaction with decision-making support is an open question. As visitor restrictions remain in place, neurocritical care physicians must work to adapt to meet family communication needs in new, creative ways .
