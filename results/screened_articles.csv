PubMed,PMID/DOI,41422040,Diaphragmatic pacing system from the point of view of the patients: 14 years of clinical experience and follow-up.,"High cervical spinal diseases (C1-C4), resulting in paralysis of the respiratory muscles, makes the person dependent on invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) for life support. Although effective from a ventilatory point of view, IMV is associated with increased morbidity and mortality; ventilated patients have higher rates of respiratory complications, a significant reduction in life expectancy, and above all, a serious psychological repercussion with estrangement from the world. Diaphragmatic pacing system (DPS) is a well-established technique capable of restoring paraphysiological ventilation. A narrative review of the case history and their follow-up of 13 patients dependent on life support ventilation who have been implanted since 2011 in the Neurocritical Care Unit of the Niguarda Hospital, Milan. Diaphragmatic pacing system was successful implanted in all the patients: of them 9 were affected by traumatic cervical SCI, 2 by Arnold Chiari sequelae, 1 due to a spontaneous ischemia. One patient with Pompe disease was included although his pathophysiology primarly affects the diaphragm instead the high cervical spine tract. During the 14 years follow-up, 92% of patients (12/13) used DPS and in 42 % of them (5/12 patients) we were able to be disconnected from IMV for at least 12 h. One of the patients (7.7%) was completely weaned from IMV and the tracheostomy was finally removed. One patient needed hospitalization for a respiratory complication. All the patients perceived their quality of life to be excellent or good. The long-term follow-up of 13 patients with DPS suggests that the implant could be a potential long-term alternative to IMV, particularly in terms of quality of life. The diaphragmatic stimulator protects from IMV associated respiratory complications, therefore reducing hospitalization. Allowing spontaneous breathing for a variable number of hours enables the caregiver to support the individual more effectively, facilitating their reintegration into daily social and work activities. Diaphragmatic pacing system does not eliminate the disability but allows for more independent years of life with a greater possibility of social reintegration.",Stagni Giuliana; Curto Francesco; Giacomini Matteo; Pozzi Federico; Chieregato Arturo,"Journal of anesthesia, analgesia and critical care",2025.0,,,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41422040/,Journal Article,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,False,"The paper focuses on patients' experiences with diaphragmatic pacing systems, not family members, relatives, or caregivers.

PubMed,PMID/DOI,41357501,Application of sugar-free cola solution based on the ICOCFAS score in oral care of non-artificial airway patients with severe neurological conditions.,"This study aimed to explore the effect of using a coke solution based on the Intensive Care Oral Care Frequency Assessment Scale (ICOCFAS) score in oral care of patients with severe neurological conditions without an artificial airway. A total of 80 patients with severe non-artificial airways admitted to the neurological intensive care unit of our hospital from January 2023 to January 2024 were enrolled and divided into a control group (40 cases) and an observation group (40 cases). The control group was given routine oral care (0.9% saline gauze wipe). The observation group received oral care with gauze soaked in sugar-free cola solution and compared the family satisfaction of patients with complications of the modified Beck oral score between the two groups after implementing the program. After the implementation of the program, the modified Beck oral score of patients in the observation group was lower than that of the control group on days 3, 5, and 7, with statistical significance (<i>p</i> < 0.05). The complication rate of the observation group was lower than that of the control group, with statistical significance (<i>p</i> < 0.05). The satisfaction degree of patients' families in the observation group was higher than that of the control group, with statistical significance (<i>p</i> < 0.05). The application of sugar-free cola solution based on the ICOCFAS score in oral care of patients with severe neurological non-artificial airway has a good effect. It can significantly improve the oral health status of these patients, with a low complication rate, high safety, and high satisfaction of patients' families, making it worthy of promotion and application.",Wang Qingmei; Fan Yuanyuan; Chen Mei; Chen Ping,Frontiers in medicine,2025.0,12,,1684863,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41357501/,Journal Article,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,True,"The study involves adult patients in a Neuro-ICU setting with severe neurological conditions, examines family satisfaction (focus), uses a quantitative design, and is in English.

PubMed,PMID/DOI,40908419,"Neuropalliative Care in the Emergency Department: Three Roles, One Goal.","Over the last decade, there has been an increased focus on incorporating palliative care principles into the practice of neurocritical care and emergency medicine (EM). In this article, we describe three different roles that EM clinicians can fill as they initiate the provision of primary neuropalliative care to neurocritically ill patients: the stage setter, the spokesperson, and the screener. As the stage setter, EM clinicians start to build trust with the family by ""breaking bad news""; encouraging them to consider the patient's values, preferences, functional baseline, and directives; and providing support to the family during this emotional time as they hand them over to the admitting team who will continue this conversation. As the spokesperson, EM clinicians are involved in early treatment decisions, including whether the patient is admitted to the acute care service or the intensive care unit or transferred to a tertiary care facility, with the goal of preventing both the overuse and underuse of life-sustaining treatment. Lastly, as the screener, EM clinicians have a role to ensure that patients with chronic neurological diseases and patients with a medical history that puts them at high-risk of developing a neurological emergency have goals-of-care conversations and have acceptable control of their daily symptom burden. Further investigation is needed before interventions targeting the practice of neuropalliative care in the emergency department can be developed.",Hendershot Kristopher A; Ouchi Kei,Neurocritical care,2025.0,,,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40908419/,Journal Article; Review,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,True,"The paper focuses on neuropalliative care for neurocritically ill adults, involving family members through roles like 'stage setter' and 'spokesperson'.

PubMed,PMID/DOI,40770584,Role of Music Therapy in Neurocritical Care for Patients with Acute Brain Injury with Disorders of Consciousness: A Narrative Review and Proposed Framework for Practice.,"Music therapy (MT) holds promise as a treatment for patients with severe acute brain injury (SABI) with disorders of consciousness (DoC) admitted to critical care units. MT leverages the intrinsic properties of music to engage patients and their families, promoting recovery through neurological, psychological, and physiological mechanisms. Although MT is routinely practiced in intensive care and rehabilitation settings, its applications in a neurocritical care context during acute DoC treatment and recovery are underexplored. Further, the subjective nature of music, music preferences, and the variability in patient responses to music-particularly in patients with SABI and DoC-pose unique challenges for implementing a one-size-fits-all approach. Through our institution's experience with MT and a review of previously published evidence, this article illustrates the application of our MT approach as a noninvasive, holistic, and individualized intervention. A case vignette explores MT in the clinical care of a patient with SABI admitted to the neurocritical care unit across a 9-week period, demonstrating the potential of MT to enhance quality of care and recovery outcomes over time. A family impact statement and emerging practice framework are also included to further elucidate the ways in which MT may enhance quality of care and patient recovery in neurocritical care settings.",Devlin Kerry; Ansari Junaid; Mathur Rohan; Shah Vishank; Pantelyat Alexander; Suarez Jose I,Neurocritical care,2025.0,43,3,1078-1090,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40770584/,Journal Article; Review,,Humans; Brain Injuries; Consciousness Disorders; Critical Care; Music Therapy,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,True,"The paper focuses on adult patients with acute brain injury (SABI) in neurocritical care, includes family perspectives, addresses psychological impact through music therapy, and is written in English.

PubMed,PMID/DOI,40752304,Spinal neurosurgery: Trends in female authorship contribution over 5-Year publication history.,"In the last few years, more efforts have been made to increase gender equity in medical specialties. Nevertheless, spinal neurosurgery continues to be one of the most male-dominated subspecialties in neurosurgery. This bibliometric analysis sought to explore the representation of female authors in major neurosurgical publications between September 2017 and August 2022, with a focus on first and last authorship roles across journals and countries. The paper analyzed 3171 unique publications within a framework of 93 high-impact neurosurgery-related journals. Results showed that female authors were 14,25 % of first authors and 7,88 % of last authors, and that only 2,11 % of articles had both female first and last authors. Country of affiliation and the journal of publication significantly influenced the author's gender representations, with Scandinavian states and certain journals, like Neurocritical Care, showing relatively high percentages of female authorship. Even if there has been minor progress over the recent past, disparities nowadays persist, potentially limiting diversity in perspectives and advancements in this field. These disparities underline the presence and the influence of systemic and cultural factors impeding gender equity, and underscoring the critical need for proactive measures to foster it, including mentorship programs, institutional support, and policies for balanced opportunities. The COVID-19 pandemic amplified inequities in this field, disproportionately impacting female academics due to increased domestic responsibilities without the corresponding implementation of support systems. The significant role of mentorship in improving female representation was also highlighted by this analysis: our data indicated higher collaboration rates between female first and last authors in the field of spinal neurosurgery. To address these challenges, efforts must be made starting during residency, with the aim of targeting systemic barriers and cultural biases. The implementation of inclusive policies, like on-site childcare programs, and fostering international collaboration, might help to reduce these disparities and to ensure that diversity drives innovation in spinal neurosurgery. Such an approach is essential for addressing inequity, which is not merely a matter of fairness but is central to advancing the field. This would ensure that only talent and hard work are what determine success in spinal neurosurgery, which is imperative for the progress of the speciality, enabling diverse perspectives to shape the future of patient care, research, and academic leadership.",Campanaro Giovanni; Centini Francesca Romana; Sicca Cecilia; Davico Jazmin; Musella Emanuele; Chebaro Kamel; Totis Francesca; Cannizzaro Delia,Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society of Australasia,2025.0,140,,111523,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40752304/,Journal Article; Review,,Humans; Authorship; Female; Bibliometrics; Neurosurgery; Male; Gender Equity,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,False,"The paper focuses on gender representation of authors in spinal neurosurgery publications, not on family members' experiences, psychological impacts, or care-related outcomes.

PubMed,PMID/DOI,40481284,Characterizing Stressors and Coping Strategies Among Caregivers of Patients with Severe Acute Brain Injury by Level of Distress.,"Family caregivers of patients with severe acute brain injury (SABI) who commit to tracheostomy and/or percutaneous endoscopic/surgical gastrostomy for the patient often develop chronic emotional distress. To inform future interventions to mitigate this distress, we characterized the stressors and coping strategies of caregivers of patients with SABI with varying levels of emotional distress during the acute and postacute stages of treatment. We conducted semistructured interviews with family caregivers of patients with SABI around the time of neurological intensive care unit discharge (T1) and at 2-month follow-up (T2). All caregivers included in this current study completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale at T1 and/or T2. We then stratified transcripts by caregiver distress level, characterizing caregivers who scored > 11 on at least one Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale subscale as ""high distress"" and ≤ 11 as ""low distress."" We conducted deductive, conceptual content analysis to compare perceived stressors and coping strategies employed at both time points. Caregivers in both strata reported many similar stressors at each time point, including ongoing uncertainty. However, there were also differences in stressors by level of distress and time point of assessment. At T1, high-distress caregivers reported pronounced stress related to navigating the health care system and communicating with providers, staff, and the patient. At T2, high-distress caregivers noted heightened difficulty with transitioning to long-term caregiving, co-occurring complex emotions, and communication with family and friends. Conversely, low-distress caregivers focused on challenges with team-based medical decision making at T2. Clear differences in coping strategies also emerged, such that high-distress caregivers relied primarily on avoidance at both points, whereas low-distress caregivers incorporated more problem-solving and self-care strategies. Psychosocial interventions for caregivers of patients with SABI are needed to reduce emotional distress. Skills should be applied to relevant topics based on time since neurological intensive care unit discharge and distress level. Skills should focus on reducing avoidance, promoting active coping, and targeting the perceived stressors specific to high-distress versus low-distress caregivers revealed here.",Meurer Katherine J; Presciutti Alexander M; Bannon Sarah M; Kubota Rina; Baskaran Nithyashri; Kim Jisoo; Zhang Qiang; Reichman Mira; Fishbein Nathan S; Lichstein Kaitlyn; Motta Melissa; Muehlschlegel Susanne; Reznik Michael E; Jaffa Matthew N; Creutzfeldt Claire J; Fehnel Corey R; Tomlinson Amanda D; Williamson Craig A; Vranceanu Ana-Maria; Hwang David Y,Neurocritical care,2025.0,,,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40481284/,Journal Article,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,True,"The paper focuses on caregivers of patients with severe acute brain injury (SABI), addressing stressors, coping strategies, and psychological impacts (anxiety, depression).

PubMed,PMID/DOI,39735015,Integrating Family Involvement in Neuro-Intensive Care: A Pathway to Enhanced Family Satisfaction in Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Management.,"Introduction Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major health concern due to its poor clinical and functional outcome and its impact on family homeostasis. Often, the stressed and anxious family is not involved in the care process until the rehabilitation phase. This study aimed to evaluate the integration of family involvement in the neuro-intensive care of TBI patients on family satisfaction. Materials and methods This pre-test-post-test quasi-experimental study involved 70 families of moderate and severe TBI patients, divided equally into experimental and control groups. A guideline, Family Involvement in the Care of TBI (FIC-TBI), was developed. The key elements of this guideline were structured communication, participation in basic care, and shared decision-making. FIC-TBI was integrated into the critical care management of TBI. The impact of FIC-TBI was evaluated using the Family Satisfaction in the ICU Care Unit 24R (FS-ICU 24R) tool. Results Data analysis was done through paired and unpaired t-tests as well as analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). The results showed statistically significant differences in the post-test family satisfaction scores between the experimental and control groups. The adjusted mean satisfaction scores of components such as satisfaction with care (F(1, N-2)=984.63; p<0.001), satisfaction with decision-making (F(1, N-2)=1489.63; p<0.001), and overall satisfaction (F(1, N-2)=712.87; p<0.001) were higher in the experimental group. The study found a significant correlation between family satisfaction levels and variables such as gender and education. Conclusions This study was done with the objective to evaluate the impact of integration of family involvement into the neuro-intensive care of TBI on family satisfaction. The findings demonstrated that the FIC-TBI guideline improved satisfaction across multiple dimensions, such as care, communication, decision-making, and overall experience. The study also found a significant correlation between family satisfaction and gender and education.

PubMed,PMID/DOI,39643583,Development of web- and mobile-based shared decision-making tools in the neurological intensive care unit.,"In the neurological intensive care unit (neuroICU), patients with severe acute brain injury (SABI) are rendered unable to make their own healthcare decisions. The responsibility of making life-or-death decisions, such as goals of care, is carried by surrogate decision-makers, usually families. In addition to the burden of decision-making, the emotional burden on families is further compounded by prognostication uncertainty, time-pressure for decision-making, and difficulties in understanding and interpreting the patient's values and preferences, ultimately resulting in potential clinician-family communication breakdown. Despite these challenges, there is currently no guidance on how to best approach these difficult decisions. Shared decision-making (SDM) has emerged as the recommended approach to improve clinician-family communication, empowering surrogates to take an active role in decision-making by providing a structured framework for information exchange, deliberation, and treatment decisions. Decision aids (DAs) facilitate SDM by offering balanced, accessible, unbiased information and helping surrogates decide according to patients' values. This review highlights the potential advantage of digital over paper-based DAs, including improved accessibility, interactivity, and personalization, and the integration of emerging technologies to enhance DA effectiveness. Additionally, we review the current digital DAs developed for the neuroICU setting.",Liu Winnie L; Zhang Lidan; Djamasbi Soussan; Tulu Bengisu; Muehlschlegel Susanne,Neurotherapeutics : the journal of the American Society for Experimental NeuroTherapeutics,2025.0,22,1,e00503,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39643583/,Journal Article; Review,,"Humans; Intensive Care Units; Decision Making, Shared; Internet; Mobile Applications; Critical Care; Decision Support Techniques; Neurology",,,,,,eng,,,,,,,True,"The paper focuses on family decision-making in neuroICU settings, addressing psychological burden and communication challenges.

Improved emergency and trauma medicine response, in addition to expanding efforts to prevent premature withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment, has led to an increased number of patients with prolonged DoC. High-quality bedside care of patients with DoC is key to improving long-term functional outcomes. However, there is a paucity of DoC-specific evidence guiding clinicians on efficacious bedside care that can promote medical stability and recovery of consciousness. This Viewpoint describes the state of current DoC bedside care and identifies knowledge and practice gaps related to patient care with DoC collated by the Care of the Patient in Coma scientific workgroup as part of the Neurocritical Care Society's Curing Coma Campaign. The gap analysis identified and organized domains of bedside care that could affect patient outcomes: clinical expertise, assessment and monitoring, timing of intervention, technology, family engagement, cultural considerations, systems of care, and transition to the post-acute continuum.

PubMed,PMID/DOI,39371233,A Nationwide Survey of Critical Care Training in India.,"The 3-year training in the critical care medicine (CCM) specialty is a relatively new recognized program in India. This program has been run at a few premier institutes across India over the past few years. The present study aimed to get a critical appraisal of the 3-year training program in CCM from the initial 50 trained Indian intensivists, regarding their research, publications, and self-perceived clinical training adequacy in the various areas of the CCM. This was a prospective cross-sectional study. The list of participants (initial trainees who completed the course between 2015-2021) was compiled by contacting the respective teachers of the institutes that were permitted and recognized by the competent national authority to run a 3-year training course in CCM in India. A questionnaire was developed with questions related to demographic details; self-reports about clinical training program adequacy measured on the Likert scale; and their research area, publications, and current job profiles. After receipt of institutional ethics committee approval, responses from the participants were collected through Google Forms, which were sent through e-mails. Responses were received from 51 of 62 participants. Among the 51, the majority were male (43; 84%), and their basic training was in anesthesiology (88%). All of them had conducted at least one mandatory research project; three-fourths were prospective observational. The main areas of research projects were cardiovascular (20%), followed by respiratory (18%), sepsis and infection (18%), and renal (14%). Only less than one-third reported being published in any PubMed-indexed journal, with most as a first authorship (93%). One-fourth to one-third of participants reported inadequate training in areas such as extracorporeal therapies and financial and administrative managerial skills in critical care, followed by cardiac and neurocritical care and research methodology. Eight (16%) underwent further training, including 6 from outside India. The present study critically evaluated the 3-year training in the CCM from the perspective of trainees who completed the program in India; highlighting areas of inadequate training such as extracorporeal therapies and financial and administrative managerial skills.

PubMed,PMID/DOI,39313855,Integration of Palliative Care in Neurosurgical Critical Care : Insights from a Single-Center Perspective.,"Palliative care is a specialized approach designed to enhance the quality of life for both patients and their families, offering patient-centered care through comprehensive assessment and care planning. However, the integration of palliative care within neurocritical care settings has been relatively understudied. This descriptive study aims to identify the characteristics, palliative care needs, and outcomes of patients referred to palliative care services during admission to the neurosurgical intensive care unit (NS-ICU). A retrospective analysis of adults admitted to the NS-ICU at a referral hospital between December 2019 and December 2021 was conducted. The study focused on those referred to the inpatient palliative care team with diagnoses of non-traumatic brain hemorrhage, traumatic brain injury, or brain neoplasm. Excluded were patients who died before palliative care consultation or lacked sufficient information. The investigation assessed demographic and clinical characteristics at consultation, along with post-consultation hospital outcomes derived from medical records and interview notes. In this study involving 38 enrolled patients, the median age was 65, with 42.1% females. The most prevalent diagnosis was nontraumatic brain hemorrhage (47.4%). Reasons for palliative care consultation included psychosocial support (95%), goal-of-care discussions (68%), decision-making support (50%), and communication facilitation (39%). The median time from NS-ICU admission to consultation was 3.5 days (interquartile range, 1-8 days), and all interviews involved family members. Key decision topics encompassed mechanical ventilation (23.7%) and tracheostomy (21.1%). Patient preferences for life-sustaining treatment could be estimated in only 47.4% of cases, often resulting in treatment disagreement. Among the 38 patients, 26 (68.4%) died during admission. Before the consultation, full code status, partial code status, and comfort care alone were reported as 32%, 66%, and 2%, respectively; post-consultation, these figures shifted to 11%, 42%, and 47%, respectively. Palliative care was predominantly sought for psychosocial support and discussions concerning goals of care. Despite challenges in ascertaining patient treatment preferences, palliative care consultations proved invaluable in aiding family members and facilitating treatment decision-making.

PubMed,PMID/DOI,39130984,Augmented Reality-Guided External Ventricular Drain Placement: A Case Report.,"The placement of an external ventricular drain (EVD) is a critical neurosurgical procedure used to relieve intracranial pressure in patients with conditions such as hydrocephalus, traumatic brain injury, and intracranial hemorrhage. Traditional methods rely heavily on anatomical landmarks and the surgeon's experience, which can lead to variability in outcomes and increased risk of complications. Neuronavigation, while available, is infrequently used due to the size, cost, and set-up times associated with these devices. This report explores the use of a headset-based augmented reality (AR) system for guidance during the EVD placement procedure. We describe an AR system that overlays a 3D model of the patient's cranial anatomy, derived from preoperative imaging, onto the patient's head. This system is a head-mounted display and utilizes a rapid fiducial-less registration to provide the surgeon with visualization of 3D anatomy, and targeted trajectories. The system was used with a 32-year-old patient undergoing EVD placement prior to a cranioplasty. Due to the atypical cranial anatomy and due to prior procedures and midline shift, this relatively high-risk catheter placement was an ideal circumstance for the use of AR guidance during the EVD placement. This report described an early use of AR for EVD placement and represents a substantial advancement in neurosurgical practice, offering enhanced precision, efficiency, and safety. Further large-scale studies are warranted to validate these findings and explore the broader applicability of AR in other neurosurgical procedures.",Janssen Andrew; Wang Arthur; Dumont Aaron S; Delashaw Johnny,Cureus,2024.0,16,7,e64403,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39130984/,Case Reports; Journal Article,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,False,"The paper is a case report (n=1) and focuses on technical aspects of AR-guided EVD placement, not on family/caregiver perspectives or psychological outcomes."
PubMed,PMID/DOI,38897212,Post-Intensive Care Syndrome in Neurocritical Care Patients.,"Post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) refers to unintended consequences of critical care that manifest as new or worsening impairments in physical functioning, cognitive ability, or mental health. As intensive care unit (ICU) survival continues to improve, PICS is becoming increasingly recognized as a public health problem. Studies that focus on PICS have typically excluded patients with acute brain injuries and chronic neurodegenerative problems. However, patients who require neurocritical care undoubtedly suffer from impairments that overlap substantially with those encompassed by PICS. A major challenge is to distinguish between impairments related to brain injury and those that occur as a consequence of critical care. The general principles for the prevention and management of PICS and multidomain impairments in patients with moderate and severe neurological injuries are similar including the ICU liberation bundle, multidisciplinary team-based care throughout the continuum of care, and increasing awareness regarding the challenges of critical care survivorship among patients, families, and multidisciplinary team members. An extension of this concept, PICS-Family (PICS-F) refers to the mental health consequences of the intensive care experience for families and loved ones of ICU survivors. A dyadic approach to ICU survivorship with an emphasis on recognizing families and caregivers that may be at risk of developing PICS-F after neurocritical care illness can help improve outcomes for ICU survivors. In this review, we will summarize our current understanding of PICS and PICS-F, emerging literature on PICS in severe acute brain injury, strategies for preventing and treating PICS, and share our recommendations for future directions.",Dangayach Neha S; Kreitzer Natalie; Foreman Brandon; Tosto-Mancuso Jenna,Seminars in neurology,2024.0,44,3,398-411,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38897212/,Journal Article; Review,,Humans; Critical Care; Intensive Care Units; Family; Critical Illness,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,True,"The paper addresses neurocritical care patients (adults) with severe acute brain injuries and explicitly discusses PICS-F (mental health consequences for families), meeting inclusion criteria for population, focus (family perspective), and language.

PubMed,PMID/DOI,38262382,Two Decades of Stroke in the United States: A Healthcare Economic Perspective.,"Stroke is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the USA and has implications on the financial health of patients, families, and healthcare systems. The objective of this study aimed to determine the economic perspective of stroke on the national healthcare system for the past 2 decades. This retrospective study of inpatient subjects from 2000 to 2020 with stroke was collected from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP). We queried patients admitted primarily for ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke. Patients were evaluated for demographics, length of stay (LOS), mortality, and hospital charges. Statistical Z-testing with a significance of p &lt; 0.05 was conducted for the analysis. During the study period, 12,158,747 stroke subjects were studied, with 51.9% female and a mean age of 70.08 (±0.16) years old. The mean rate of stroke discharges per 100,000 persons was 187.71 (±3.44), decreasing from 200 to 193 during the study (p = 0.16). The mean percentage of deaths was 8.78% (±0.17), which decreased from 10.96% to 6.81% (p = 0.00). The mean LOS was 6.28 days (±0.08), which increased from 6.70 to 7.15 (p = 0.00). During the study period, the aggregated national bill was USD 725 billion. The mean hospital charges per patient were USD 57,178 (±1,504), increasing from USD 19,647 to USD 121,765 per person during the study period (p = 0.00), while mean hospital costs per stay were USD 15,781 (±330). These data closely conform to an exponential growth pattern, and forecasting per patient charges for the next 10 years demonstrates a cost of USD 287,836 by 2030. Our data show that the rate and mortality of stroke have decreased, but its charges and costs are increasing. The improvement in outcomes could be multifactorial such as establishment of comprehensive stroke centers and evolving treatment modalities.

PubMed,PMID/DOI,38020602,Use of magnetic source imaging to assess recovery after severe traumatic brain injury-an MEG pilot study.,"Severe TBI (sTBI) is a devastating neurological injury that comprises a significant global trauma burden. Early comprehensive neurocritical care and rehabilitation improve outcomes for such patients, although better diagnostic and prognostic tools are necessary to guide personalized treatment plans. In this study, we explored the feasibility of conducting resting state magnetoencephalography (MEG) in a case series of sTBI patients acutely after injury (~7 days), and then about 1.5 and 8 months after injury. Synthetic aperture magnetometry (SAM) was utilized to localize source power in the canonical frequency bands of delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma, as well as DC-80 Hz. At the first scan, SAM source maps revealed zones of hypofunction, islands of preserved activity, and hemispheric asymmetry across bandwidths, with markedly reduced power on the side of injury for each patient. GCS scores improved at scan 2 and by scan 3 the patients were ambulatory. The SAM maps for scans 2 and 3 varied, with most patients showing increasing power over time, especially in gamma, but a continued reduction in power in damaged areas and hemispheric asymmetry and/or relative diminishment in power at the site of injury. At the group level for scan 1, there was a large excess of neural generators operating within the delta band relative to control participants, while the number of neural generators for beta and gamma were significantly reduced. At scan 2 there was increased beta power relative to controls. At scan 3 there was increased group-wise delta power in comparison to controls. In summary, this pilot study shows that MEG can be safely used to monitor and track the recovery of brain function in patients with severe TBI as well as to identify patient-specific regions of decreased or altered brain function. Such MEG maps of brain function may be used in the future to tailor patient-specific rehabilitation plans to target regions of altered spectral power with neurostimulation and other treatments.",Sarma Anand Karthik; Popli Gautam; Anzalone Anthony; Contillo Nicholas; Cornell Cassandra; Nunn Andrew M; Rowland Jared A; Godwin Dwayne W; Flashman Laura A; Couture Daniel; Stapleton-Kotloski Jennifer R,Frontiers in neurology,2023.0,14,,1257886,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38020602/,Journal Article,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,False,"The study focuses on neurological recovery (brain function assessment via MEG) in patients with severe TBI, not on family members' psychological experiences, needs, or perspectives.

PubMed,PMID/DOI,37972989,Use of Family Photographs Reduces Restlessness in Neurocritical Care Patients.,"BACKGROUND: Patients admitted to the neuroscience intensive care unit often experience varying states of confusion and restlessness. The purpose of this study was to examine restlessness in acutely confused patients through use of familiar photographs. METHODS : This randomized prospective pilot study placed family photographs (photos) on the bedrail of confused patients during the night shift (8 pm to 4 am ) in a neuroscience intensive care unit. Wrist actigraphy was used to examine restlessness when patients were turned to face the photos versus when they were not facing the photos. RESULTS: The 20 patients enrolled provided 34 nights worth of data during which 32 640 actigraph readings were obtained. On the first night of study, the odds of wrist movement were higher when the patient was facing the photos compared with not (odds ratio, 1.51; 95% confidence interval, 1.42-1.61). During subsequent nights, the odds of wrist movement were lower when the patient was facing the photos compared with not (odds ratio, 0.82; 95% confidence interval, 0.75-0.90). CONCLUSION : Use of familiar photos does not change restlessness, agitation, or delirium on the first night of observation. However, the use of familiar photos may decrease restlessness on the subsequent nights. There are important subjective observations from researchers and family that suggest all subjects had a noticeable response when initially seeing the familiar photos.",Givens Cole; Nairon Emerson B; Jackson Mona; Vashisht Ayushi; Olson DaiWai M,The Journal of neuroscience nursing : journal of the American Association of Neuroscience Nurses,2024.0,56,1,6-11,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37972989/,Randomized Controlled Trial; Journal Article,,Humans; Prospective Studies; Psychomotor Agitation; Pilot Projects; Actigraphy; Anxiety,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,False,"The study focuses on reducing restlessness in patients (a clinical outcome) using family photographs, but does not explicitly address family members' perceptions, experiences, or psychological impacts.

PubMed,PMID/DOI,37671206,Delayed Traumatic Intracerebral Hematoma: A Pathophysiological Classification and Literature Review.,"Delayed traumatic intracerebral hematoma (DTICH) is a relatively common occurrence after a traumatic brain injury (TBI). Several case series have been performed to study DTICH, many of which offer different definitions of DTICH. Some definitions involve a delayed progression of an existing hemorrhage, and others involve a de novo intracerebral hematoma that was not evident on the initial trauma evaluation. We propose a classification system for DTICH that accounts for the subtleties in the clinical manifestation and pathophysiology of the different types of DTICH, with the ultimate goal of providing strategies to prevent and manage DTICH. Based on the senior author's clinical experience, we generated a classification system for DTICH, and each type of DTICH was illustrated with a case. We defined type 1A (case 1A), the classic presentation of DTICH as predominantly characterized in the literature, as an intracerebral hematoma unseen on initial computed tomography imaging that typically develops five days to one week following blunt or penetrating head trauma. We defined type 1B (case 1B) as a hematoma that forms after at least one week following trauma in areas of the brain initially hemorrhage-free. We defined type 2 (case 2) as a hematoma that develops rapidly following a surgical evacuation of a different hematoma. We defined type 3 (case 3) as a hematoma that develops after a traumatic head injury in areas of non-hemorrhagic contusion, usually frontal or temporal. A literature review was performed using select terms on PubMed to find articles related to DTICH, excluding articles describing DTICH from an underlying vascular injury. After performing the literature review and screening articles by title and/or abstract, a total of 79 articles were found to meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria. We recorded which type of DTICH from our classification system best correlated with the articles in our literature review. Taken together with results from the literature, the proposed classification system is based on the senior author's clinical experience. Overall, DTICH is a relatively common occurrence after head trauma, and our pathophysiologic classification has the potential to help outline future studies to recognize and prevent the development of DTICH.",Ziechmann Robert; Pathak Sami M; Welch Jonathan; Villanueva Philip,Cureus,2023.0,15,8,e42987,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37671206/,Journal Article; Review,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,False,"The paper focuses on the pathophysiology and classification of delayed traumatic intracerebral hematoma (DTICH) without addressing family perspectives, psychological impacts, or caregiver experiences.

PubMed,PMID/DOI,37257063,Committee on Surgical Combat Casualty Care position statement: Neurosurgical capability for the optimal management of traumatic brain injury during deployed operations.,"Experiences over the last three decades of war have demonstrated a high incidence of traumatic brain injury (TBI) resulting in a persistent need for a neurosurgical capability within the deployed theater of operations. Despite this, no doctrinal requirement for a deployed neurosurgical capability exists. Through an iterative process, the Joint Trauma System Committee on Surgical Combat Casualty Care (CoSCCC) developed a position statement to inform medical and nonmedical military leaders about the risks of the lack of a specialized neurosurgical capability. The need for deployed neurosurgical capability position statement was identified during the spring 2021 CoSCCC meeting. A triservice working group of experienced forward-deployed caregivers developed a preliminary statement. An extensive iterative review process was then conducted to ensure that the intended messaging was clear to senior medical leaders and operational commanders. To provide additional context and a civilian perspective, statement commentaries were solicited from civilian clinical experts including a recently retired military trauma surgeon boarded in neurocritical care, a trauma surgeon instrumental in developing the Brain Injury Guidelines, a practicing neurosurgeon with world-renowned expertise in TBI, and the chair of the Committee on Trauma. After multiple revisions, the position statement was finalized, and approved by the CoSCCC membership in February 2023. Challenges identified include (1) military neurosurgeon attrition, (2) the lack of a doctrinal neurosurgical capabilities requirement during deployed combat operations, and (3) the need for neurosurgical telemedicine capability and in-theater computed tomography scans to triage TBI casualties requiring neurosurgical care. Challenges identified regarding neurosurgical capabilities within the deployed trauma system include military neurosurgeon attrition and the lack of a doctrinal requirement for neurosurgical capability during deployed combat operations. To mitigate risk to the force in a future peer-peer conflict, several evidence-based recommendations are made. The solicited civilian commentaries strengthen these recommendations by putting them into the context of civilian TBI management.

Methods Using univariate and multivariate analysis (model adjusted for age, Glasgow Coma Scale score (GCS), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Scores, mechanical ventilation, transition to comfort measures only (CMO), and death by neurologic criteria), we examined CCM team members' involvement in the care of Amharic/Cambodian/Khmer/Somali/Spanish/Vietnamese patients admitted to our neurocritical care service between 2014-2022, factors associated with CCM utilization, and changes in CCM utilization after a QI initiative was implemented in 2020 to encourage healthcare providers to consult the CCM team. Results Compared to eligible patients (n=827) who did not receive CCM referral, patients with CCM involvement (n=121) were younger (49 [interquartile range, IQR 38,63] vs. 56 [IQR 42,68] years, p = 0.002), had greater illness severity (admission GCS 8.5 [IQR 3,14] vs. 14 [IQR 7,15], p < 0.001, SOFA scores (5 [IQR 2,8] vs. 4 [IQR2,6], p = 0.007), and more frequently required mechanical ventilation (67% vs. 40%, odds ratio, OR 3.07, 95% CI 2.06,4.64), with higher all-cause mortality (20% vs. 12%, RR 1.83, 95% CI 1.09, 2.95), and with a higher rate of transition to CMO (11.6% vs. 6.2%, OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.03;3.66).

PubMed,PMID/DOI,37059958,PREDICT-TBI: Comparison of Physician Predictions with the IMPACT Model to Predict 6-Month Functional Outcome in Traumatic Brain Injury.,"Predicting functional outcome in critically ill patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) strongly influences end-of-life decisions and information for surrogate decision makers. Despite well-validated prognostic models, clinicians most often rely on their subjective perception of prognosis. In this study, we aimed to compare physicians' predictions with the International Mission on Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials in TBI (IMPACT) prognostic model for predicting an unfavorable functional outcome at 6 months after moderate or severe TBI. PREDICT-TBI is a prospective study of patients with moderate to severe TBI. Patients were admitted to a neurocritical care unit and were excluded if they died or had withdrawal of life-sustaining treatments within the first 24 h. In a paired study design, we compared the accuracy of physician prediction on day 1 with the prediction of the IMPACT model as two diagnostic tests in predicting unfavorable outcome 6 months after TBI. Unfavorable outcome was assessed by the Glasgow Outcome Scale from 1 to 3 by using a structured telephone interview. The primary end point was the difference between the discrimination ability of the physician and the IMPACT model assessed by the area under the curve. Of the 93 patients with inclusion and exclusion criteria, 80 patients reached the primary end point. At 6 months, 29 patients (36%) had unfavorable outcome. A total of 31 clinicians participated in the study. Physicians' predictions showed an area under the curve of 0.79 (95% confidence interval 0.68-0.89), against 0.80 (95% confidence interval 0.69-0.91) for the laboratory IMPACT model, with no statistical difference (p = 0.88). Both approaches were well calibrated. Agreement between physicians was moderate (κ = 0.56). Lack of experience was not associated with prediction accuracy (p = 0.58). Predictions made by physicians for functional outcome were overall moderately accurate, and no statistical difference was found with the IMPACT models, possibly due to a lack of power.

There has been an explosion of post-ICU clinics among the general critical care population, with their use largely justified based on the management of PICS and PICS-F, terminology which excludes brain injured patients. In contrast, neurocritical care recovery clinics are not common and not well-described. There is however evidence in the neuro-ICU population supporting the provision of ""dyadic"" care, whereby the patient and caregiver are treated as one unit. Brain injured populations likely experience many of the same PICS phenomena as medically ill patients but are not represented in this body of literature. These patients deserve the same level of follow-up as other patients who have experienced critical illness. We propose a neuro-ICU transitional care clinic that addresses PICS-like symptoms and is modeled after transitional care provided to other brain injured populations.

To better understand the long-term mental health impact of a Neuro-ICU admission, we examined the dyadic interdependence between depression and anxiety at Neuro-ICU admission with 3-month quality of life (QoL) for patients and caregivers in a longitudinal, observational cohort study. We assessed depressive and anxiety symptoms (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; HADS) reported by neurologically intact patients (n = 72) and their caregivers (n = 72) within 2 weeks of Neuro-ICU admission (baseline) and 3-months post-discharge (follow-up). We examined the longitudinal association between dyadic depression and anxiety at Neuro-ICU admission and 3-month QoL (World Health Organization; QOL-BREF) across four domains (Physical, Psychological, Social relationships, and Environmental QoL) in separate actor-partner interdependence models (APIM) for patients and caregivers. In the overall models, patients' own baseline depression levels were negatively associated with their own 3-month QoL in all domains (β =  - 0.53 to - 0.64, p < 0.001), and for caregivers, only in the psychological (β =  - 0.73, p < .001) and social relationships (β =  - 0.56, p < .001) domains. No actor effects were found for one's own baseline anxiety impacting one's own 3-month QoL.

Reports that provided dosing regimens and patient outcomes were included. Thirty-two articles were screened. Five articles were selected for inclusion in this review and detailed the clinical courses of 11 patients. Five of the 11 patients received CBD during the chronic epilepsy stage, while the remaining 6 received it during a period of acute status epilepticus. Patients were trialed on an average of 9 anti-epileptic drugs prior to CBD administration, after which 9 of the 11 patients experienced a reduction of seizure activity. Dosing of CBD ranged between 5-25 mg/kg/day and was titrated based on patient response to therapy. Adverse effects were relatively benign and were generally limited to gastrointestinal discomfort, reported after seizure cessation. CBD may provide a potentially efficacious and safe management strategy in refractory status epilepticus, including patients with new-onset refractory status epilepticus and febrile infection-related epilepsy syndrome.

PubMed,PMID/DOI,36260235,Current state of high-fidelity multimodal monitoring in traumatic brain injury.,"Multimodality monitoring of patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) is primarily performed in neuro-critical care units to prevent secondary harmful brain insults and facilitate patient recovery. Several metrics are commonly monitored using both invasive and non-invasive techniques. The latest Brain Trauma Foundation guidelines from 2016 provide recommendations and thresholds for some of these. Still, high-level evidence for several metrics and thresholds is lacking. Regarding invasive brain monitoring, intracranial pressure (ICP) forms the cornerstone, and pressures above 22 mmHg should be avoided. From ICP, cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) (mean arterial pressure (MAP)-ICP) and pressure reactivity index (PRx) (a correlation between slow waves MAP and ICP as a surrogate for cerebrovascular reactivity) may be derived. In terms of regional monitoring, partial brain tissue oxygen pressure (PbtO<sub>2</sub>) is commonly used, and phase 3 studies are currently ongoing to determine its added effect to outcome together with ICP monitoring. Cerebral microdialysis (CMD) is another regional invasive modality to measure substances in the brain extracellular fluid. International consortiums have suggested thresholds and management strategies, in spite of lacking high-level evidence. Although invasive monitoring is generally safe, iatrogenic hemorrhages are reported in about 10% of cases, but these probably do not significantly affect long-term outcome. Non-invasive monitoring is relatively recent in the field of TBI care, and research is usually from single-center retrospective experiences. Near-infrared spectrometry (NIRS) measuring regional tissue saturation has been shown to be associated with outcome. Transcranial doppler (TCD) has several tentative utilities in TBI like measuring ICP and detecting vasospasm. Furthermore, serial sampling of biomarkers of brain injury in the blood can be used to detect secondary brain injury development. In multimodal monitoring, the most important aspect is data interpretation, which requires knowledge of each metric's strengths and limitations. Combinations of several modalities might make it possible to discern specific pathologic states suitable for treatment. However, the cost-benefit should be considered as the incremental benefit of adding several metrics has a low level of evidence, thus warranting additional research.",Lindblad Caroline; Raj Rahul; Zeiler Frederick A; Thelin Eric P,Acta neurochirurgica,2022.0,164,12,3091-3100,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36260235/,"Journal Article; Review; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,"Humans; Retrospective Studies; Intracranial Pressure; Brain Injuries, Traumatic; Cerebrovascular Circulation; Brain Injuries; Monitoring, Physiologic",,,,,,eng,,,,,,,False,"The paper focuses on medical monitoring techniques for traumatic brain injury without addressing family perspectives, psychological impacts, or caregiver experiences.

The COVID-19 pandemic has further intensified this experience in addition to exacerbating clinician and resident burnout. To ameliorate some of these concerns, a team of resident and medical student trainees implemented a virtual shared medical appointment (vSMA) program for inpatients with acute cerebrovascular disorders and their caregivers. The authors hypothesized that an early intervention in the form of a vSMA improves patient and caregiver health literacy and preparedness while simultaneously educating clinical trainees on effective communication skills and reducing clinician burnout. Patients and caregivers of admitted patients were identified through a census of neurosurgery, neurocritical care, and neurology electronic medical records. A weekly 60-minute secure virtual session consisted of introductions and a 10-minute standardized presentation on cerebrovascular disease management, followed by participant-guided discussion. Participants completed presession and postsession surveys. Through this small feasibility study data were obtained regarding present challenges, both expected and unforeseen. A total of 170 patients were screened, and 13 patients and 26 caregivers participated in at least 1 vSMA session. A total of 6 different healthcare providers facilitated sessions. The vSMA program received overwhelmingly positive feedback from caregivers. Survey responses demonstrated that 96.4% of caregivers and 75% of patients were satisfied with the session, 96.4% of caregivers and 87.5% of patients would recommend this type of appointment to a friend or family member, and 88.8% of providers reported feeling validated by conducting the session. The participant group had a 20% greater percentage of patients discharged home without home needs compared to the nonparticipant group. The primary obstacles encountered included technological frustrations with the consent process and the sessions themselves. Implementation of a vSMA program at a tertiary care center during a pandemic was feasible. Themes caregivers expressed on the postsession survey included better understanding of caring for a stroke patient and coping with the unpredictability of a patient's prognosis.

Our primary objective was to determine if early integration of palliative care consultations within this cohort was feasible and would impact understanding, decision-making and emotional support to patients and their surrogate decision makers. Our secondary objective was to evaluate the long-term impact of early palliative care assessment on the development of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This was a single center prospective pilot study. Patients with moderate-to-severe ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes were randomized into two arms. The control arm received standard intensive care and the intervention arm received an additional early palliative care consultation within 72 hours of hospitalization. Study assessments with the participants were obtained on day 1-3, and day 5-7 of care with comparisons of total scores on the Questionnaire on Communication (QOC), Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Furthermore, comparisons of HADS and PTSD DSM-5 (PCL- 5) scores were completed at 3 months. Linear mixed effects models were conducted to examine the association between intervention and participant's scores. A total of 22 participants were enrolled between February 2019 and April 2020.

Comprehensive assessments of family experiences and support needs after SABI are lacking. Our objective is to elicit ""on-the-ground"" perspectives about the experiences and needs of families of patients with SABI. Two-phase qualitative study of families and multidisciplinary U.S. healthcare professionals (mHCPs) with expertise in SABI: Phase 1 included semistructured interviews to generate formative findings; phase 2 entailed facilitated discussions to confirm and expand initial findings. Phase 1: academic medical center; phase 2: virtual workshop. Phase 1 included seven family members and 12 mHCPs. Phase 2 included nationally recruited stakeholders (17 family members and 12 mHCPs). None. We explored: 1) what are families' needs in the first 48 hours? 2) How are these needs addressed? and 3) How can hospitals better meet these needs? Qualitative analysis included inductive and deductive approaches guided by a conceptual ecological model. Four major needs were identified: 1) challenges in coping with uncertainty in early prognostication, 2) inattention to physical needs of family, 3) deficits in compassionate and consistent communication, and 4) need for engagement with families as stakeholders in improving future practices. Participants' recommendations included: 1) ways to communicate more clearly and consistently, 2) better assistance with navigating resources and access to places for families to care for themselves, and 3) opportunities for families to remain connected with their loved ones, social support networks, and the clinical team.

PubMed,PMID/DOI,35217998,"Pregabalin for Recurrent Seizures in Critical Illness: A Promising Adjunctive Therapy, Especially for cyclic Seizures.","Pregabalin (PGB) is an effective adjunctive treatment for focal epilepsy and acts by binding to the alpha2-delta subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels to reduce excitatory neurotransmitter release. Limited data exist on its use in the neurocritical care setting, including cyclic seizures-a pattern of recurrent seizures occurring at nearly regular intervals. Although the mechanism underpinning cyclic seizures remains elusive, spreading excitation linked to spreading depolarizations may play a role in seizure recurrence and periodicity. PGB has been shown to increase spreading depolarization threshold; hence, we hypothesized that the magnitude of antiseizure effect from PGB is more pronounced in patients with cyclic versus noncyclic seizures in a critically ill cohort with recurrent seizures. We conducted a retrospective case series of adults admitted to two academic neurointensive care units between January 2017 and March 2019 who received PGB for treatment of seizures. Data collected included demographics, etiology of brain injury, antiseizure medications, and outcome. Continuous electroencephalogram recordings 48 hours before and after PGB administration were reviewed by electroencephalographers blinded to the administration of antiseizure medications to obtain granular data on electrographic seizure burden. Cyclic seizures were determined quantitatively (i.e., < 50% variation of interseizure intervals for at least 50% of consecutive seizures). Coprimary outcomes were decrease in hourly seizure burden in minutes and decrease in seizure frequency in the 48 hours after PGB initiation. We used nonparametric tests for comparison of seizure frequency and burden and segmented linear regression to assess PGB effect. We included 16 patients; the median age was 69 years, 11 (68.7%) were women, three (18.8%) had undergone a neurosurgical procedure, and five (31%) had underlying epilepsy. All seizures had focal onset; ten patients (62.5%) had cyclic seizures. The median hourly seizure burden over the 48 hours prior to PGB initiation was 1.87 min/hour (interquartile range 1.49-8.53), and the median seizure frequency was 1.96 seizures/hour (interquartile range 1.06-3.41). In the 48 hours following PGB (median daily dose 300 mg, range 75-300 mg), the median number of seizures per hour was reduced by 0.80 seizures/hour (95% confidence interval 0.19-1.40), whereas the median hourly seizure burden decreased by 1.71 min/hour (95% confidence interval 0.38-3.04). When we compared patients with cyclic versus noncyclic seizures, there was a relative decrease in hourly seizure frequency (- 86.7% versus - 2%, p = 0.04) and hourly seizure burden (- 89% versus - 7.8%, p = 0.03) at 48 hours. PGB was associated with a relative reduction in seizure burden in neurocritically ill patients with recurrent seizures, especially those with cyclic seizures, and may be considered in the therapeutic arsenal for refractory seizures.

PubMed,PMID/DOI,35055335,Agreement and Reliability Analysis of Machine Learning Scaling and Wireless Monitoring in the Assessment of Acute Proximal Weakness by Experts and Non-Experts: A Feasibility Study.,"Assessing the symptoms of proximal weakness caused by neurological deficits requires the knowledge and experience of neurologists. Recent advances in machine learning and the Internet of Things have resulted in the development of automated systems that emulate physicians' assessments. The application of those systems requires not only accuracy in the classification but also reliability regardless of users' proficiency in the real environment for the clinical point-of-care and the personalized health management. This study provides an agreement and reliability analysis of using a machine learning-based scaling of Medical Research Council (MRC) proximal scores to evaluate proximal weakness by experts and non-experts. The system trains an ensemble learning model using the signals from sensors attached to the limbs of patients in a neurological intensive care unit. For the agreement analysis, we investigated the percent agreement of MRC proximal scores and Bland-Altman plots of kinematic features between the expert- and non-expert scaling. We also analyzed the intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) of kinematic features and Krippendorff's alpha of the observers' scaling for the reliability analysis. The mean percent agreement between the expert- and the non-expert scaling was 0.542 for manual scaling and 0.708 for autonomous scaling. The ICCs of kinematic features measured using sensors ranged from 0.742 to 0.850, whereas the Krippendorff's alpha of manual scaling for the three observers was 0.275.

The impact of NVA-HARTI on patient outcomes and differences between NVA-HARTI and ventilator-associated healthcare-associated respiratory tract infections (VA-HARTI) are poorly understood. Our objectives were to report the incidence, hospital length of stay (LOS), ICU LOS, and mortality in NVA-HARTI patients and compare these characteristics to VA-HARTI in neurocritical care patients. This cohort study was conducted in a neurosurgical ICU in Moscow. From 2011 to 2020, all patients with an ICU LOS > 48 h were included. A competing risk model was used for survival and risk analysis. A total of 3,937 ICU admissions were analyzed. NVA-HARTI vs VA-HARTI results were as follows: cumulative incidence 7.2 (95%CI: 6.4-8.0) vs 15.4 (95%CI: 14.2-16.5) per 100 ICU admissions; incidence rate 4.2 ± 2.0 vs 9.5 ± 3.0 per 1000 patient-days in the ICU; median LOS 32 [Q1Q3: 21, 48.5] vs 46 [Q1Q3: 28, 76.5] days; median ICU LOS 15 [Q1Q3: 10, 28.75] vs 26 [Q1Q3: 17, 43] days; mortality 12.3% (95%CI: 7.9-16.8) vs 16.7% (95%CI: 13.6-19.7). The incidence of VA-HARTI decreased over ten years while NVA-HARTI incidence did not change. VA-HARTI was an independent risk factor of death, OR 1.54 (1.11-2.14), while NVA-HARTI was not. Our findings suggest that NVA-HARTI in neurocritical care patients represents a significant healthcare burden with relatively high incidence and associated poor outcomes.

PubMed,PMID/DOI,35007934,Prognostication in Acute Neurological Emergencies.,"For patients with acute, serious neurological conditions presenting to the emergency department (ED), prognostication is typically based on clinical experience, scoring systems and patient co-morbidities. Because estimating a poor prognosis influences caregiver decisions to withdraw life-sustaining therapy, we investigated the consistency of prognostication across a spectrum of neurology physicians. Five acute neurological presentations (2 with large hemispheric infarction; 1 with brainstem infarction, 1 with lobar hemorrhage, and 1 with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy) were selected for a department-wide prognostication simulation exercise. All had presented to our tertiary care hospital's ED, where a poor outcome was predicted by the ED neurology team within 24 hours of onset. Relevant clinical, laboratory and imaging data available before ED prognostication were presented on a web-based platform to 120 providers blinded to the actual outcome. The provider was requested to rank-order, from most to least likely, the predicted 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score. To determine the accuracy of individual outcome predictions we compared the patient's the actual 90-day mRS score to highest ranked predicted mRS score. Additionally, the group's ""weighted"" outcomes, accounting for the entire spectrum of mRS scores ranked by all respondents, were compared to the actual outcome for each case. Consistency was compared between pre-specified provider roles: neurology trainees versus faculty; non-vascular versus vascular faculty. Responses ranged from 106-110 per case. Individual predictions were highly variable, with predictions matching the actual mRS scores in as low as 2% of respondents in one case and 95% in another case. However, as a group, the weighted outcome matched the actual mRS score in 3 of 5 cases (60%). There was no significant difference between subgroups based on expertise (stroke/neurocritical care versus other) or experience (faculty versus trainee) in 4 of 5 cases. Acute neuro-prognostication is highly variable and often inaccurate among neurology providers. Significant differences are not attributable to experience or subspecialty expertise.

PubMed,PMID/DOI,33821402,Predictors of Family Dissatisfaction with Support During Neurocritical Care Shared Decision-Making.,"There is a critical need to improve support for families making difficult shared decisions about patient care with clinicians in the neuroscience ICU (neuro-ICU). The aim of this study is to identify patient- and family-related factors associated with dissatisfaction with shared decision-making support among families of neuro-critically ill patients. We conducted a retrospective observational cohort study using survey data that had been collected from a consecutive sample of family members of patients in the neuro-ICU (one family member per patient) at two US academic centers. Satisfaction with shared decision-making support on ICU discharge had been measured among family members using one specific Likert scale item on the Family Satisfaction in the ICU 24 survey, a validated survey instrument for families of patients in the ICU. We dichotomized top-box responses for this particular item as an outcome variable and identified available patient- and family-related covariates associated with dissatisfaction (i.e., less than complete satisfaction) via univariate and multivariate analyses. Among 355 surveys, 180 (49.5%) of the surveys indicated dissatisfaction with support during decision-making. In a multivariate model, no preexisting characteristics of families or patients ascertainable on ICU admission were predictive of dissatisfaction. However, among family factors determined during the ICU course, experiencing three or fewer formal family meetings (odds ratio 1.93 [confidence interval 1.13-3.31]; p = 0.01) was significantly predictive of dissatisfaction with decisional support in this cohort with an average patient length of stay of 8.6 days (SD 8.4). There was also a trend toward a family's decision to keep a patient as full code, without treatment limitations, being predictive of dissatisfaction (odds ratio 1.80 [confidence interval 0.93-3.51]; p = 0.08). Family dissatisfaction with neuro-ICU shared decision-making support is not necessarily predicted by any preexisting family or patient variables but appears to correlate with participating in fewer formal family meetings during ICU admission.

Intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) is associated with high rates of mortality and morbidity. Prognosticating after ICH is complex and may be influenced by clinicians' subjective impressions and biases, which may, in turn, influence decision making regarding the level of care provided. The aim of this study was to qualitatively explore perceptions of neurocritical care in relation to the expected functional outcome for ICH patients. Qualitative study using semi-structured interviews with neurocritical care doctors and nurses. Neurocritical care (NCC) department in a UK neuroscience tertiary referral center. Eleven neurocritical care nurses, five consultant neurointensivists, two stroke physicians, three neurosurgeons. None. We conducted 21 semi-structured interviews and identified five key themes: (1) prognostic uncertainty (2) subjectivity of good versus poor outcome (3) perceived inappropriate care (PIC) situations (including for frail elderly patients) (4) challenging nature of decision-making (5) clinician distress. Caring for severely affected ICH patients in need of neurocritical care is challenging, particularly with frail elderly patients. Awareness of the challenges could facilitate interventions to improve decision-making for this group of stroke patients and their families, as well as measures to reduce the distress on clinicians who care for this patient group.

PubMed,PMID/DOI,32509320,Recovering together: building resiliency in dyads of stroke patients and their caregivers at risk for chronic emotional distress; a feasibility study.,"A stroke is a sudden, life-altering event with potentially devastating consequences for survivors and their loved ones. Despite advances in endovascular and neurocritical care approaches to stroke treatment and recovery, there remains a considerable unmet need for interventions targeting the emotional impact of stroke for both patients and their informal caregivers. This is important because untreated emotional distress becomes chronic and negatively impacts quality of life in both patients and caregivers. Our team previously used mixed methods to iteratively develop a six-session modular dyadic intervention to prevent chronic emotional distress in patients with stroke and their informal caregivers called ""Recovering Together"" (RT) using feedback from dyads and the medical team. The aim of the current study is to test the feasibility of recruitment, acceptability of screening and randomization methods, acceptability of RT, satisfaction with RT, feasibility of the assessment process at all time points, and acceptability of outcome measures. Secondarily, we aimed to explore within-treatment effect sizes and change in clinically significant symptoms of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress (PTS). The larger goal was to strengthen methodological rigor before a subsequent efficacy trial. We conducted a feasibility randomized controlled trial to evaluate the RT intervention relative to minimally enhanced usual care (MEUC) in stroke patients admitted to a Neurosciences Intensive Care Unit (Neuro-ICU). Dyads were enrolled within 1 week of hospitalization if they met specific eligibility criteria. Assessments were done via paper and pencil at baseline, and electronically via REDCap or over the phone at post-intervention (approximately 6 weeks after baseline), and 3 months later. Assessments included demographics, resiliency intervention targets (mindfulness, coping, self-efficacy, and interpersonal bond), and emotional distress (depression, anxiety, and PTS). Primary outcomes were feasibility and acceptability markers. Secondary outcomes were depression, anxiety, PTS, mindfulness, coping, self-efficacy, and interpersonal bond. We consented 20 dyads, enrolled 17, and retained 16. Although many patients were missed before we could approach them, very few declined to participate or dropped out once study staff made initial contact. Feasibility of enrollment (87% of eligible dyads enrolled), acceptability of screening, and randomization (all RT dyads retained after randomization) were excellent. Program satisfaction (RT post-test M = 11.33/12 for patients M = 12/12 for caregivers), and adherence to treatment sessions (six of seven RT dyads attending 4/6 sessions) were high. There were no technical difficulties that affected the delivery of the intervention. There was minimal missing data. For both patients and caregivers, participation in RT was generally associated with clinically significant improvement in emotional distress symptoms from baseline to post-test. Participation in MEUC was associated with clinically significant worsening in emotional distress. Although some of the improvement in emotional distress symptoms decreased in the RT group between post-test to 3 months, these changes were not clinically significant. RT was also associated with substantial decrease in frequency of individuals who met criteria for clinically significant symptoms, while the opposite was true for MEUC. There were many lessons that informed current and future research. This study provided evidence of feasibility and signal of improvement in RT, as well as necessary methodological changes to increase recruitment efficiency before the future hybrid efficacy-effectiveness trial.

PubMed,PMID/DOI,32371682,The Experience of a Neurocritical Care Admission and Discharge for Patients and Their Families: A Qualitative Analysis.,"A qualitative assessment of discharge resource needs is important for developing evidence-based care improvements in neurocritically ill patients. We conducted a quality improvement initiative at an academic hospital and included all patients admitted to the neuroscience intensive care unit (ICU) during an 18-month period. Telephone assessments were made at 3 to 6 months after admission. Patients or caregivers were asked whether they had adequate resources upon discharge and whether they had any unanswered questions. The content of responses was reviewed by a neurointensivist and a neurocritical care nurse practitioner. A structured codebook was developed, organized into themes, and applied to the responses. Sixty-one patients or caregivers responded regarding access to resources at discharge with 114 individual codable responses. Responses centered around 5 themes with 23 unique codes: satisfied, needs improvement, dissatisfied, poor post-ICU care, and poor health. The most frequently coded responses were that caregivers believed their loved one had experienced an unclear discharge (n = 11) or premature discharge (n = 12). Two hundred four patients or caregivers responded regarding unanswered questions or additional comments at follow-up, with 516 codable responses. These centered around 6 themes with 26 unique codes: positive experience, negative experience, neutral experience, medical questions, ongoing medical care or concern, or remembrance of time spent in the ICU. The most frequent response was that caregivers or patients stated that they received good care (n = 115). Multiple concerns were brought up, including lack of follow-up after hospitalization (n = 15) and dissatisfaction with post-ICU care (n = 15). Obtaining qualitative responses after discharge provided insight into the transition from critical care.

Between 2015 and 2016, we enrolled neurologically intact patients and informal caregivers of patients who reported demographics and PTSD symptoms (PTSD Checklist-Specific; PCL-S) during neuro-ICU admission and completed a QoL assessment (World Health Organization Quality of Life; WHOQOL-BREF) 3 months later. Clinical data were extracted from medical records. We ran two bivariate correlation matrices among PTSD symptom dimensions in patients and caregivers. Then, we used multiple linear regression to examine the prospective association of total PCL-S scores with each QoL domain in both patients and caregivers after adjusting for clinically important variables. Next, we explored differential associations between the 4 PTSD symptom dimensions and each QoL domain in both patients and caregivers, adjusting for sex and age. A total of 70 patients (45.7% women, 84.3% white, mean age 52.08 years) and 64 caregivers (64.1% women, 90.6% white, mean age 53.12 years) were included. PTSD symptom dimensions were moderately strongly correlated among patients (r = 0.65-0.79, p < 0.001) and caregivers (r = 0.55-0.78, p < 0.001). For both patients and caregivers, greater PTSD symptom severity was prospectively associated with lower QoL in all domains (β = - 0.289 to - 0.622; p < 0.05). Our exploratory analysis revealed that greater numbing symptoms were associated with lower psychological QoL in patients (β: - 0.397, p = 0.038), and lower physical (β: - 0.409, p = 0.014), psychological (β: - 0.519, p = 0.001), and social QoL (β: - 0.704, p < 0.001) in caregivers. Greater re-experiencing symptoms were associated with lower physical QoL in both patients (β: - 0.422, p = 0.047) and caregivers (β: - 0.4, p = 0.041).

PubMed,PMID/DOI,32346842,Experiences of Family Caregivers After an Acute Neurological Event.,"Family of patients hospitalized in an intensive care unit (ICU) often immediately assume the role of caregiver to an individual with significant health care needs. The transition into this caregiver role may be sudden and unexpected; their experiences are not well understood. The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore experiences of family caregivers in the neurocritical care unit in order to identify areas for enhancing patient- and family-centered care. This single-center ethnographic study explored the use of systems theory to investigate the perceptions, experiences, and attitudes of family/caregivers regarding their relationships and interactions between the patient, other family, members of the healthcare provider team, and health system after an acute neurological event in Argentina. Field notes from 9 weeks of direct observation together with transcripts from nine semi-structured interviews (transcribed verbatim and translated from Spanish to English) were analyzed using a grounded theory approach. Nine themes emerged based on iterative thematic analysis, including: adjusting to a changed life, managing emotions, changing role, relying on faith, redefining recovery, participating in patient care, depending on clinical experts, el tratohumano, and finding unity in purpose. In the neurocritical care environment, an important intermediary role exists for family/caregivers and the patient, other family, and healthcare providers. The results demonstrate the potential for family, providers, and the health system to influence family/caregivers' experience with neurocritical care.

This role requires family to establish satisfactory communication with clinicians. Posthospital patient satisfaction with communication scores were lower than desired. Investigators assumed family member satisfaction with communication could influence patient satisfaction scores. Including family members in multidisciplinary daily clinical rounds was implemented in a 22-bed neurointensive care unit (ICU). Family members who attended rounds were compared with those who did not. Changes in clinician time devoted to rounding were measured. The intervention increased time devoted to clinical rounds by 4 minutes per patient on average. Rounding dose correlated positively while depression correlated negatively with family satisfaction with communication. No harm, such as family member agitation, anxiety, or complaints, was found.

PubMed,PMID/DOI,31997141,The Impact of Resilience Factors and Anxiety During Hospital Admission on Longitudinal Anxiety Among Dyads of Neurocritical Care Patients Without Major Cognitive Impairment and Their Family Caregivers.,"Anxiety is common in patients experiencing neurocritical illness and their family caregivers. Resilience factors like mindfulness and coping skills may be protective against symptoms of emotional distress, including anxiety. Less is known about the interplay of anxiety symptoms and resilience factors between patients and caregivers. The purpose of this study is to examine the trajectory of anxiety symptoms among dyads of neurocritical care patients without major cognitive impairment and their family caregivers and to elucidate the relationship between resiliency (e.g., mindfulness and coping) and anxiety in these dyads. Prospective, longitudinal study of adults admitted to the neurological intensive care unit (Neuro-ICU) and their caregivers. Dyads of patients (N = 102) and family caregivers (N = 103) completed self-report measures of mindfulness (Cognitive Affective Mindfulness Scale-Revised) and coping (Measure of Current Status-Part A) during Neuro-ICU hospitalization and anxiety symptoms (anxiety subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) during hospitalization and at 3- and 6-month follow-up. We used actor-partner interdependence modeling to predict the effect of one's own baseline characteristics on one's own and one's partner's future anxiety symptoms. Rates of clinically significant anxiety symptoms were 40% for patients and 42% for caregivers at baseline. Of these, 20% of patients and 23% of caregivers showed moderate and severe symptoms. Approximately, one-third of patients and caregivers reported clinically significant anxiety symptoms at 3- and 6-month follow-ups, with more than 20% endorsing moderate or severe symptoms. Patients' own baseline mindfulness, coping, and anxiety symptoms were associated with lower anxiety symptoms at all time points (ps < 0.001)-this was also true for caregivers. For both patients and caregivers, one's own baseline mindfulness predicted their partner's anxiety symptoms 3 months later (p = 0.008), but not at 6-month follow-up. Anxiety symptoms in Neuro-ICU patient-caregiver dyads are high through 6 months following admission. Mindfulness is interdependent and protective against anxiety in dyads at 3-month but not 6-month follow-up.

PubMed,PMID/DOI,31773544,"Impact of a Devastating Brain Injury Pathway on Outcomes, Resources, and Organ Donation: 3 Years' Experience in a Regional Neurosciences ICU.","To assess the impact of introducing a devastating brain injury (DBI) pathway on patient outcome, intensive care unit (ICU) resources, and organ donation practice in the first 3 years of implementation in a regional neurosciences ICU in the South West of England. Patients with DBI admitted to our ICU between 2015 and 2018 were identified from our ICU database and their outcomes compared to those of non-DBI patients. Data were also obtained from the national potential donor audit to compare organ donation metrics before and after the introduction of the DBI pathway. Organ donation metrics in DBI patients and non-DBI patients were compared once the pathway had been implemented. We admitted 85 DBI patients (1.3% of all admissions), with a significantly shorter median length of ICU stay than in non-DBI patients, 1.14 versus 2.93 days (p < 0.001). Decisions for withdraw life-sustaining treatments (WLST) were made significantly earlier in DBI patients, median 26.2 versus 84.8 h (p < 0.001). Over 8% of DBI patients survived, while 31% progressed to brain death compared to 7.1% in the general population (p < 0.001), and 25% become solid organ donors compared to 1.3% of the general population (p < 0.001). There was an increase in the proportion of donors after brain death (DBD) to donors after circulatory death (DCD) in the 3 years following the introduction of the DBI pathway (p = 0.024). There was also an increased proportion of DBD donors to DCD donors of 76% versus 24% in the DBI group compared to 62% versus 38% (p = 0,002) in the non-DBI population. Prognostic scoring systems do not provide accurate estimates of survival rate in this population. Admitting patients with perceived DBI to ICU and avoiding the early WLST allows identification of unexpected survivors and gives families more time in decision making at the end of life. The DBI pathway increases the potential for organ donation and increases the proportion of DBD donors.

Building an effective ICU CEEG program demands adequate EEG equipment and human resources. This may not be available in developing healthcare systems. This study sought to shed light on the real-life utility of CEEG at a tertiary healthcare center in the developing healthcare system of Saudi Arabia. <b>Methods:</b> This is a retrospective review of CEEG findings, along with mortality and duration of hospitalization of patients who had CEEG during a 12-month period at the adult ICU at the King Abdulaziz University Hospital (KAUH) in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. <b>Results:</b> A total of 202 CEEG records were identified. A total of 52 records showed non-convulsive seizures (NCS); 10 clearly fulfilled criteria for non-convulsive status epilepticus. There were 120 patients that had clinical seizures upon presentation. Among them, 36 (30%) had NCS on EEG. The proportion of patients who were deceased at 60 days was higher in patients with NCS than those who didn't have NCS (42% vs 27%, χ <sup>2</sup> = 4.4, df=2, p=0.03). There was no statistically significant association between having rhythmic or periodic patterns without NCS and mortality at 60 days or length of hospital stay. <b>Conclusion:</b> This retrospective study demonstrates a real-world experience from a tertiary care center in Saudi Arabia, a developing healthcare system. ICU CEEG was found to be effective in detecting potentially harmful subclinical patterns, supporting the need to develop ICU CEEG programs. However, the incurred excesses in morbidity and mortality associated with CEEG patterns were relatively modest.

However, reliable data are scarcely available from the developing world. We aimed to analyze the incidence, epidemiology, microbial etiology, and outcomes of HAIs in an NCCU of a tertiary care teaching hospital in a high-income, developing country. In this 3-year retrospective cohort study, all patients admitted to the NCCU at the Ibn Sina Hospital in Kuwait for ≥ 2 calendar days were included. Patient demographics, hospitalization, and details of ICU-acquired infections were evaluated. Patient-related outcomes included hospital and ICU length of stay (LOS) and in-hospital mortality. Among 913 patients with a total of 4921 ICU days, 79 patients had 109 episodes of HAIs. The overall incidence rate and incidence density of HAIs were 11.9/100 patients and 22.1/1000 ICU days, respectively. Multiple episodes of infection were documented in 29% of patients. The most prevalent infections were urinary tract infections (UTIs; 40/109 [37%]), bloodstream infections (30/109 [28%]), and pneumonia (16/109 [15%]). Seventy-six percent of infections were device-associated infections. A total of 158 pathogens were isolated, of which 109 were Gram-negative bacteria. Of the 40 Gram-positive bacteria, 22 were staphylococci. Seven infections were due to Clostridium difficile. There were 15 Staphylococcus aureus isolates, 47% of which were methicillin resistant. Two episodes of UTIs were due to Candida species. There were 84 Enterobacteriaceae isolates, 24% of which were extended-spectrum β-lactamase producers. All Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were susceptible to aminoglycosides and carbapenems. Klebsiella species were the most common pathogen (45/158 [28%]), causing pneumonia (11/33 isolates [33%]), bloodstream infections (12/37 isolates [32%]), and UTIs (16/52 isolates [31%]). One episode of bloodstream infection was due to multidrug resistant Acinetobacter baumanii which was susceptible only to colistin. Only pneumonia was independently associated with mortality, while all HAIs that occurred were significantly associated with a prolonged ICU LOS. This is the first HAI surveillance study in an NCCU in Kuwait, and our results demonstrate the burden of HAIs on the neurologically injured patient, regardless of the site of infection.

PubMed,PMID/DOI,31486026,Review: Post-Intensive Care Syndrome: Unique Challenges in the Neurointensive Care Unit.,"Within the last couple of decades, advances in critical care medicine have led to increased survival of critically ill patients, as well as the discovery of notable, long-term health challenges in survivors and their loved ones. The terms post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) and PICS-family (PICS-F) have been used in non-neurocritical care populations to characterize the cognitive, psychiatric, and physical sequelae associated with critical care hospitalization in survivors and their informal caregivers (e.g., family and friends who provide unpaid care). In this review, we first summarize the literature on the cognitive, psychiatric, and physical correlates of PICS and PICS-F in non-neurocritical patient populations and draw attention to their long-term negative health consequences. Next, keeping in mind the distinction between disease-related neurocognitive changes and those that are associated directly with the experience of a critical illness, we review the neuropsychological sequelae among patients with common neurocritical illnesses. We acknowledge the clinical factors contributing to the difficulty in studying PICS in the neurocritical care patient population, provide recommendations for future lines of research, and encourage collaboration among critical care physicians in all specialties to facilitate continuity of care and to help elucidate mechanism(s) of PICS and PICS-F in all critical illness survivors. Finally, we discuss the importance of early detection of PICS and PICS-F as an opportunity for multidisciplinary interventions to prevent and treat new neuropsychological deficits in the neurocritical care population.",LaBuzetta Jamie Nicole; Rosand Jonathan; Vranceanu Ana-Maria,Neurocritical care,2019.0,31,3,534-545,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31486026/,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Review",,"Activities of Daily Living; Anxiety; Brain Diseases; Brain Edema; Brain Injuries, Traumatic; Caregivers; Cerebral Hemorrhage; Chronic Disease; Cognitive Dysfunction; Critical Care; Critical Illness; Depression; Humans; Muscle Weakness; Muscular Diseases; Neurology; Polyneuropathies; Quality of Life; Status Epilepticus; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; Stroke; Subarachnoid Hemorrhage",,,,,,eng,,,,,,,True,"The paper focuses on neurocritical care populations (Neuro-ICU patients with severe acute brain injuries) and addresses psychological impacts (anxiety, depression, burden) of critical illness on survivors and their caregivers, meeting all inclusion criteria."
PubMed,PMID/DOI,31451253,Evaluation of burden and depression among caregivers of stroke patients: The role of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy feeding tube.,"Malnutrition problems are very common after a stroke. Several clinical studies have shown the contribution of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) feeding after stroke in terms of improving nutritional status and reducing mortality. The aim of this study is to compare the burden and depression among caregivers of ischemic stroke patients fed with PEG and orally. A total of 63 caregivers of patients with acute ischemic stroke who were followed up in the neurointensive care unit with modified Rankin Scale 4 or 5 were recruited in this cross-sectional survey. Clinical data of patients and demographical profile as age, gender, kinship to patient, income, and level of education of caregivers were recorded. On their 3rd-month follow-up visit, Beck Depression Inventory and The Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) were administered to caregivers to evaluate depressive symptoms and caregiver burden. A semi-structured questionnairre was developed and conducted by the researchers with the caregivers to assess their thoughts of nutrition. Thirty-two caregivers of stroke patients on PEG and 31 caregivers of stroke patients who were fed orally were evaluated. The groups did not differ statistically in terms of demographic variables and depression scores (p > 0.05). However, the mean score of ZBI was significantly higher in the group of caregivers of stroke patients who were fed orally (p = 0.00). Caregivers of stroke patients on PEG had higher scores of caregivers' thoughts of nutrition support therapy questionnairre (p = 0.00). Our findings demonstrate that caregivers of stroke patients report lower burden and higher level of positive thinking with PEG feeding than oral feeding. This suggests that nutritional care could include convenient and practicable methods for caregivers of patients with stroke in order to meet patients' nutritional requirements.",Ertem Devrimsel Harika; Ilik Faik,Clinical nutrition ESPEN,2019.0,33,,154-157,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31451253/,Journal Article,,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Caregivers; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Enteral Nutrition; Female; Gastrostomy; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Nutritional Support; Prospective Studies; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Stroke; Surveys and Questionnaires",,,,,,eng,,,,,,,True,"The study focuses on caregivers of stroke patients (a severe acute brain injury), examines their burden and depression (psychological impact), and is conducted in English.

PubMed,PMID/DOI,31348075,"Management of Severe Bleeding in Patients Treated With Oral Anticoagulants: Proceedings Monograph From the Emergency Medicine Cardiac Research and Education Group-International Multidisciplinary Severe Bleeding Consensus Panel October 20, 2018.","In this Emergency Medicine Cardiac Research and Education Group (EMCREG)-International Proceedings Monograph from the October 20, 2018, EMCREG-International Multidisciplinary Consensus Panel on Management of Severe Bleeding in Patients Treated With Oral Anticoagulants held in Orlando, FL, you will find a detailed discussion regarding the treatment of patients requiring anticoagulation and the reversal of anticoagulation for patients with severe bleeding. For emergency physicians, critical care physicians, hospitalists, cardiologists, internists, surgeons, and family physicians, the current approach and disease indications for treatment with anticoagulants such as coumadin, factor IIa, and factor Xa inhibitors are particularly relevant. When a patient treated with anticoagulants presents to the emergency department, intensive care unit, or operating room with severe, uncontrollable bleeding, achieving rapid, controlled hemostasis is critically important to save the patient's life. This EMCREG-International Proceedings Monograph contains multiple sections reflecting critical input from experts in Emergency Cardiovascular Care, Prehospital Emergency Medical Services, Emergency Medicine Operations, Hematology, Hospital Medicine, Neurocritical Care, Cardiovascular Critical Care, Cardiac Electrophysiology, Cardiology, Trauma and Acute Care Surgery, and Pharmacy. The first section provides a description of the current indications for the treatment of patients using oral anticoagulants including coumadin, the factor IIa (thrombin) inhibitor dabigatran, and factor Xa inhibitors such as apixaban and rivaroxaban. In the remaining sections, the treatment of patients presenting to the hospital with major bleeding becomes the focus. The replacement of blood components including red blood cells, platelets, and clotting factors is the critically important initial treatment for these individuals. Reversing the anticoagulated state is also necessary. For patients treated with coumadin, infusion of vitamin K helps to initiate the process of protein synthesis for the vitamin K-dependent coagulation proteins II, VII, IX, and X and the antithrombotic protein C and protein S. Repletion of clotting factors for the patient with 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate, which includes factors II (prothrombin), VII, IX, and X and therapeutically effective concentrations of the regulatory proteins (protein C and S), provides real-time ability to slow bleeding. For patients treated with the thrombin inhibitor dabigatran, treatment using the highly specific, antibody-derived idarucizumab has been demonstrated to reverse the hypocoagulable state of the patient to allow blood clotting. In May 2018, andexanet alfa was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to reverse the factor Xa anticoagulants apixaban and rivaroxaban in patients with major bleeding. Before the availability of this highly specific agent, therapy for patients treated with factor Xa inhibitors presenting with severe bleeding usually included replacement of lost blood components including red blood cells, platelets, and clotting factors and 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate, or if not available, fresh frozen plasma. The evaluation and treatment of the patient with severe bleeding as a complication of oral anticoagulant therapy are discussed from the viewpoint of the emergency physician, neurocritical and cardiovascular critical care intensivist, hematologist, trauma and acute care surgeon, hospitalist, cardiologist, electrophysiologist, and pharmacist in an approach we hope that the reader will find extremely practical and clinically useful. The clinician learner will also find the discussion of the resumption of oral anticoagulation for the patient with severe bleeding after effective treatment important because returning the patient to an anticoagulated state as soon as feasible and safe prevents thrombotic complications. Finally, an EMCREG-International Severe Bleeding Consensus Panel algorithm for the approach to management of patients with life-threatening oral anticoagulant-associated bleeding is provided for the clinician and can be expanded in size for use in a treatment area such as the emergency department or critical care unit.",Gibler W Brian; Racadio Judy M; Hirsch Amy L; Roat Todd W,Critical pathways in cardiology,2019.0,18,3,143-166,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31348075/,Journal Article; Review,,"Administration, Oral; Anticoagulants; Cardiology; Cardiovascular Diseases; Consensus; Critical Pathways; Emergency Medical Services; Hemorrhage; Humans; Interdisciplinary Communication; Patient Care Management",,,,,,eng,,,,,,,False,"The paper focuses on medical management of severe bleeding in anticoagulant-treated patients, not on family perspectives, psychological impacts, or caregiver experiences.

This study included patients admitted to the NRICU at a university hospital in Seoul, Korea. Two time periods were defined according to the presence of a neurointensivist in the preexisting open-type NRICU: the before and after periods. Hospital medical records were queried and compared between these two time periods, as were the biannual satisfaction survey results for the families of patients. Of the 15,210 patients in the neurology department, 2,199 were admitted to the NRICU (<i>n</i>=995 and 1,204 during the before and after periods, respectively; <i>p</i><0.001). The length of stay was shorter during the after than during the before period in both the NRICU (3 vs. 4 days; <i>p</i><0.001) and the hospital overall (12.5 vs. 14.0 days; <i>p</i><0.001). Neurological consultations (2,070 vs. 3,097; <i>p</i><0.001) and intrahospital transfers from general intensive care units to the NRICU (21 vs. 40; <i>p</i>=0.111) increased from the before to after the period. The mean satisfaction scores of the families of the patients also increased, from 78.3 to 89.7. In a Cox proportional hazards model, appointing a neurointensivist did not result in a statistically significant change in 6-month mortality (hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% confidence interval, 0.652-1.031; <i>p</i>=0.089).

PubMed,PMID/DOI,31239231,Palliative Care and Communication Training in Neurosurgery Residency: Results of a Trainee Survey.,"Neurosurgeons care for critically ill patients near the end of life, yet little is known about how well their training prepares them for this role. We surveyed a random sample of neurosurgery residents to describe the quantity and quality of teaching activities related to serious illness communication and palliative care, and resident attitudes and perceived preparedness to care for seriously ill patients. A previously validated survey instrument was adapted to reflect required communication and palliative care competencies in the 2015 the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) Milestones for Neurological Surgery. The survey was reviewed for content validity by independent faculty neurosurgeons, piloted with graduating neurosurgical residents, and distributed online in August 2016 to neurosurgery residents in the United States using the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS)/Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS) Joint Section on Neurotrauma and Critical Care email listserv. Multiple choice and Likert scale responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Sixty-two responses were recorded between August 2016 and October 2016. Most respondents reported no explicit teaching on: explaining risks and benefits of intubation and ventilation (69%), formulating prognoses in neurocritical care (60%), or leading family meetings (69%). Compared to performing craniotomies, respondents had less frequent practice leading discussions about withdrawing life-sustaining treatment (61% vs. 90%, p < 0.01, ""weekly or more frequently""), and were less often observed (18% vs. 87%, p < 0.01) and given feedback on their performance (11% vs. 58%, p < 0.01). Nearly all respondents (95%) felt ""prepared to discuss withdrawing life-sustaining treatments,"" however half (48%) reported they ""would benefit from more communication training during residency."" Most (87%) reported moral distress, agreeing that they ""participated in operations and worried whether surgery aligned with patient goals."" Residents in our sample reported limited formal training, and relatively less observation and feedback, on required ACGME competencies in palliative care and communication. Most reported preparedness in this domain, but many were receptive to more training.

Close cooperation and meaningful interaction must be achieved with family members so that the patient's ""person can emerge"" through discussions. This article highlights several caveats that can subvert this complex process, including the cognitive biases that affect both clinicians and surrogates. Impact, optimism, and gain-framing biases may be particularly relevant when considering patients who are receiving neurocritical care. Practitioners need to be cognizant of the distorting influences of these biases and make attempts to neutralize them. Quality of survival and the nature and degree of deficits are often the dominant concerns after patients experience acute severe brain injuries.

PubMed,PMID/DOI,30342324,External validation of the epidemiology-based mortality score in status epilepticus in an American intensive care population.,"Although overall mortality of status epilepticus is high, baseline patient characteristics and co-morbidities may be helpful to predict outcomes and shape treatment decisions. Two previously published scoring systems exist to predict outcomes: the Status Epilepticus Severity Score (STESS) and the Epidemiology-based Mortality Score in Status Epilepticus (EMSE). However, a comparison of the two scores has not previously been completed in an American intensive care unit. We hypothesize that both scores will adequately predict the primary outcome of in-hospital death, but that the EMSE may more accurately predict functional outcomes, and significantly impact treatment decisions for both clinicians and families. We performed a retrospective analysis of all cases of status epilepticus admitted to the Neuro-Critical Care Unit (NCCU) at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center from 6/1/2014 - 8/31/2015. We collected data on age, comorbidities, EEG findings, and seizure history. The primary outcome measured was in-hospital death; secondary outcomes included length of stay in the NCCU, placement of a tracheostomy and/or a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy upon discharge, and discharge location were used as surrogate markers for outcome severity. A sensitivity and specificity analysis was carried out, in addition to a student's t-test for a comparison of the two scores. ANOVA was completed to compare secondary outcomes RESULTS: Forty-six patients were admitted to the NCCU for management of status epilepticus during June 2014 and January 2016, thirteen of which experienced in-hospital death. The median age of the sample was 60, with approximately half of the sample (52.63%) having 3 or more comorbidities. The sensitivity of both EMSE and STESS were very high (100% and 90% respectively); however, the specificities were very low (28.6% and 42.9% respectively). A student's t-test between those who experienced in-hospital death and those who did not was only significant for EMSE at the p < 0.1 level (p = 0.055). Additionally, mean EMSE scores but not STESS scores, were significantly higher (p < 0.001) for those patients who were discharged to skilled nursing facilities or with hospice than compared to those who were discharged to home or to acute inpatient rehabilitation. The EMSE and STESS may be useful to predict outcomes of status epilepticus in populations with few comorbid conditions, but are less helpful when patients have multiple medical problems. Secondly, while neither score may be specific enough to differentiate for the primary outcome of death, their utility may be helpful to predict secondary outcomes that strongly affect clinical decisions. Based on these results, we believe a prospective trial of EMSE and STESS should be carried out to obtain more information on their utility, especially in American patients who may have more relevant comorbidities than in other countries.",Yechoor Nirupama; Adeli Amir; Hafeez Shaheryar,Epilepsy research,2018.0,148,,32-36,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30342324/,Comparative Study; Journal Article; Validation Study,,Aged; Critical Care; Female; Hospital Mortality; Humans; Intensive Care Units; Male; Middle Aged; Ohio; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; Sensitivity and Specificity; Severity of Illness Index; Status Epilepticus,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,False,"The paper focuses on clinical outcomes (mortality, comorbidities, treatment decisions) without addressing family members' perceptions, experiences, or psychological impacts.

PubMed,PMID/DOI,30288437,Should We Use the IMPACT-Model for the Outcome Prognostication of TBI Patients? A Qualitative Study Assessing Physicians' Perceptions.,"<b>Introduction.</b> Shared Decision-Making may facilitate information exchange, deliberation, and effective decision-making, but no decision aids currently exist for difficult decisions in neurocritical care patients. The International Patient Decision Aid Standards, a framework for the creation of high-quality decision aids (DA), recommends the presentation of numeric outcome and risk estimates. Efforts are underway to create a goals-of-care DA in critically-ill traumatic brain injury (ciTBI) patients. To inform its content, we examined physicians' perceptions, and use of the IMPACT-model, the most widely validated ciTBI outcome model, and explored physicians' preferences for communicating prognostic information towards families. <b>Methods.</b> We conducted a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews in 20 attending physicians (neurosurgery,neurocritical care,trauma,palliative care) at 7 U.S. academic medical centers. We used performed qualitative content analysis of transcribed interviews to identify major themes. <b>Results.</b> Only 12 physicians (60%) expressed awareness of the IMPACT-model; two stated that they ""barely"" knew the model. Seven physicians indicated using the model at least some of the time in clinical practice, although none used it exclusively to derive a patient's prognosis. Four major themes emerged: the IMPACT-model is intended for research but should not be applied to individual patients; mistrust in the IMPACT-model derivation data; the IMPACT-model is helpful in reducing prognostic variability among physicians; concern that statistical models may mislead families about a patient's prognosis. <b>Discussion:</b> Our study identified significant variability of the awareness, perception, and use of the IMPACT-model among physicians. While many physicians prefer to avoid conveying numeric prognostic estimates with families using the IMPACT-model, several physicians thought that they ""ground"" them and reduce prognostic variability among physicians. These findings may factor into the creation and implementation of future ciTBI-related DAs.",Moskowitz Jesse; Quinn Thomas; Khan Muhammad W; Shutter Lori; Goldberg Robert; Col Nananda; Mazor Kathleen M; Muehlschlegel Susanne,MDM policy & practice,2018.0,3,1,2381468318757987,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30288437/,Journal Article,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,False,"The study focuses on physicians' perceptions of the IMPACT-model, not family members' experiences or perspectives.

Retrospective cohort study. National Trauma Data Bank. Adults (age > 18 yr) with moderate traumatic brain injury (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth revision codes and admission Glasgow Coma Scale score of 9-13) in the National Trauma Data Bank between 2007 and 2014. None. Demographics, mechanism of injury, hospital course, and facility characteristics were examined. Admission characteristics associated with discharge outcomes were analyzed using multivariable Poisson regression models. Of 114,066 patients, most were white (62%), male (69%), and had median admission Glasgow Coma Scale score of 12 (interquartile range, 10-13). Seventy-seven percent had isolated traumatic brain injury. Concussion, which accounted for 25% of moderate traumatic brain injury, was the most frequent traumatic brain injury diagnosis. Fourteen percent received mechanical ventilation, and 66% were admitted to ICU. Over 50% received care at a community hospital. Seven percent died, and 32% had a poor outcome, including those with Glasgow Coma Scale score of 13. Compared with patients 18-44 years, patients 45-64 years were twice as likely (adjusted relative risk, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.92-2.02) and patients over 80 years were five times as likely (adjusted relative risk, 4.66; 95% CI, 4.55-4.76) to have a poor outcome.

PubMed,PMID/DOI,28817501,Nurses Perceptions of a Novel Protocol Addressing Uniform Periods of Minimum Assessment Times.,"This quality improvement project aimed to understand the impact of a quiet time protocol on nurses and patients in the neurocritical care unit (NCCU) by comparing pretest and posttest outcomes, taking decibel readings, and abstracting chart information. Sleep is essential for maintaining a healthy life. Patients in the NCCU often do not get adequate amounts of sleep. Quiet time studies have focused on implementing periods of reduced noise levels to improve patient sleep. However, the perceptions of the caregivers about the protocols have not been taken into consideration, leading to difficulty in implementing these protocols if it impedes with the routine work of the caregivers. This was a prospective quality improvement project, with a quiet time protocol in the novel setting of the NCCU with caregiver feedback on the protocol. The quiet protocol involved decreasing light, noise, and patient interactions between 11:30 PM and 2:30 AM. There were 16 nurses who consented to the study and provided feedback via self-report questionnaires. Implementation of this protocol did not suggest a decrease in nurse enjoyment with their job (P = .51). There were significant improvements in patient sleep quality and quantity (P < .0001). In addition, there was some evidence of decrease in the noise level and number of patient disruptions. The results of this single-site project suggest that, by implementing a quiet time protocol in the NCCU, patients obtained higher levels of sleep quality and quantity.

PubMed,PMID/DOI,28169857,Intersection of prognosis and palliation in neurocritical care.,"Difficult discussions regarding end-of-life care are common in neurocritical care. Because of a patient's neurological impairment, decisions regarding continuing or limiting aggressive care must often be made by patients' families in conjunction with medical providers. This review provides perspective on three major aspects of this circumstance: prognostication, family-physician discussions, and determination of death (specifically as it impacts on organ donation). Numerous studies have now demonstrated that prediction models developed from populations of brain-injured patients may be misleading when applied to individual patients. Early care limitations may lead to the self-fulfilling prophecy of poor outcomes because of care decisions rather than disease course. A shared decision-making approach that emphasizes transmission of information and trust between families and medical providers is ethically appropriate in severely brain-injured patients and as part of the transition to end-of-life palliative care.

PubMed,PMID/DOI,28042364,Predictors of Acute Kidney Injury in Neurocritical Care Patients Receiving Continuous Hypertonic Saline.,"Continuous intravenous 3% hypertonic saline (HTS) infusions are commonly used for the management of cerebral edema following severe neurologic injuries. Despite widespread use, data regarding the incidence and predictors of nephrotoxicity are lacking. The purpose of this study was to describe the incidence and identify predictors of acute kidney injury (AKI) in neurocritical care patients administered continuous infusion HTS. This was an institutional review board-approved, multicenter, retrospective cohort study of patients receiving HTS infusions at 2 academic medical centers. A univariate analysis and multivariable logistic regression were used to identify predictors of AKI. Data regarding AKI were evaluated during treatment with HTS and up to 24 hours after discontinuation. A total of 329 patients were included in our analysis, with 54 (16%) developing AKI. Those who developed AKI experienced significantly longer stays in the intensive care unit (14.8 vs 11.5 days; <i>P</i> = .006) and higher mortality (48.1% vs 21.9%; <i>P</i> < .001). We identified past medical history of chronic kidney disease (odds ratio [OR]: 9.7, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.9-50.6; <i>P</i> = .007), serum sodium greater than 155 mmol/L (OR: 4.1, 95% CI: 2.1-8.0; <i>P</i> < .001), concomitant administration of piperacillin/tazobactam (OR: 3.9, 95% CI: 1.7-9.3; <i>P</i> = .002), male gender (OR: 3.2, 95% CI: 1.5-6.6; <i>P</i> = .002), and African American race (OR: 2.6, 95% CI: 1.3-5.2; <i>P</i> = .007) as independent predictors of AKI.

The need for systemic anticoagulation is a relative contraindication for patients with bleeding risks, especially in multitraumatic injury. We describe a case series of four trauma patients with ARDS who were managed with ECMO admitted to the neuro critical care unit at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge (UK), from January 2000 to January 2016. We performed a systematic review of the available literature to investigate the safety and efficacy of vv-ECMO in posttraumatic ARDS, focusing on the use of different anticoagulation strategies and risk of bleeding on patients with multiple injuries. Thirty-one patients were included. A heparin bolus was given in 16 cases. Eleven patients developed complications during treatment with ECMO with three cases of major bleeding. In all documented cases of bleeding a bolus and infusion of heparin was administered, aiming for an activated clotting time (ACT) target longer than 150 seconds. Two patients treated with heparin-free ECMO developed thromboembolic complications. Four patients died, and death was never directly or indirectly related to use of ECMO. vv-ECMO can be lifesaving in respiratory failure. Our experience and our literature review suggest that vv-ECMO should be considered as a rescue treatment for the management of severe hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to ARDS in trauma patients.For patients with a high risk of bleeding, the use of ECMO with no initial anticoagulation could be considered a valid option. For patients with a moderate risk of bleeding, use of a heparin infusion keeping an ACT target shorter than 150 seconds can be appropriate.

PubMed,PMID,27748614,Using personality traits to construct linear growth models of mental health in family members of individuals with severe brain injury.,"No studies have examined the impact of personality traits on mental health among caregivers of individuals with severe brain injury. Therefore, the purpose of the current study was to construct linear growth models to examine whether the personality traits of family members of individuals with severe brain injury could predict the trajectories of their own mental health-related quality of life (HRQoL), anxiety, and depression beginning in a neurointensive care unit through 1 year after injury. Danish family members of individuals with severe brain injury (n = 52) completed the Short Form-36 assessing mental HRQoL (vitality, social functioning, role limitations-emotional, mental health), anxiety, and depression across 5 time points during the 1st year after injury. The measure of personality was administered 3 months after the patients' discharge. All mental HRQoL, anxiety, and depression variables improved significantly over time. Caregivers who were less neurotic and less conscientious had higher vitality, social functioning, and mental health over time, whereas caregivers who were more agreeable had higher social functioning over time. Caregivers with lower neuroticism had lower anxiety and depression over time, as well as a more accelerated decrease in anxiety and depression. Caregivers' personality traits were strongly associated over time with mental HRQoL, anxiety, and depression, with neuroticism being especially important for trajectories of anxiety and depression. These results suggest that personality assessments for caregivers of individuals with severe brain injury could help identify those most at risk for poor mental health over the course of rehabilitation.

PubMed,PMID/DOI,26577436,Risks and benefits of stress ulcer prophylaxis in adult neurocritical care patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"Neurocritical care patients are at high risk for stress-related upper gastrointestinal (UGI) bleeding. The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the risks and benefits of stress ulcer prophylaxis (SUP) in this patient group. A systematic search of major electronic literature databases was conducted. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which researchers compared the effects of SUP (with proton pump inhibitors or histamine 2 receptor antagonists) with placebo or no prophylaxis in neurocritical care patients. The primary outcome was UGI bleeding, and secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality and nosocomial pneumonia. Study heterogeneity was sought and quantified. The results were reported as risk ratios/relative risks (RRs) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). We included 8 RCTs comprising an aggregate of 829 neurocritical care patients. Among these trials, one study conducted in a non-intensive care unit setting that did not meet our inclusion criteria was ultimately included based on further evaluation. All studies were judged as having a high or unclear risk of bias. SUP was more effective than placebo or no prophylaxis at reducing UGI bleeding (random effects: RR 0.31; 95 % CI 0.20-0.47; P < 0.00001; I (2) = 45 %) and all-cause mortality (fixed effects: RR 0.70; 95 % CI 0.50-0.98; P = 0.04; I (2) = 0 %). There was no difference between SUP and placebo or no prophylaxis regarding nosocomial pneumonia (random effects: RR 1.14; 95 % CI 0.67-1.94; P = 0.62; I (2) = 42 %). The slight asymmetry of the funnel plots raised the concern of small trial bias, and apparent heterogeneity existed in participants, interventions, control treatments, and outcome measures. In neurocritical care patients, SUP seems to be more effective than placebo or no prophylaxis in preventing UGI bleeding and reducing all-cause mortality while not increasing the risk of nosocomial pneumonia. The robustness of this conclusion is limited by a lack of trials with a low risk of bias, sparse data, heterogeneity among trials, and a concern regarding small trial bias.

PubMed,PMID/DOI,26187793,Finding a Middle Ground: Exploring the Impact of Patient- and Family-Centered Design on Nurse-Family Interactions in the Neuro ICU.,"This comparative study of two adult neuro critical care units examined the impact of patient- and family-centered design on nurse-family interactions in a unit designed to increase family involvement. A growing evidence base suggests that the built environment can facilitate the delivery of patient- and family-centered care (PFCC). However, few studies examine how the PFCC model impacts the delivery of care, specifically the role of design in nurse-family interactions in the adult intensive care unit (ICU) from the perspective of the bedside nurse. Two neuro ICUs with the same patient population and staff, but with different layouts, were compared. Structured observations were conducted to assess changes in the frequency, location, and content of interactions between the two units. Discussions with staff provided additional insights into nurse attitudes, perceptions, and experiences caring for families. Nurses reported challenges balancing the needs of many stakeholders in a complex clinical environment, regardless of unit layout. However, differences in communication patterns between the clinician- and family-centered units were observed. More interactions were observed in nurse workstations in the PFCC unit, with most initiated by family. While the new unit was seen as more conducive to the delivery of PFCC, some nurses reported a loss of workspace control. Patient- and family-centered design created new spatial and temporal opportunities for nurse-family interactions in the adult ICU, thus supporting PFCC goals. However, greater exposure to unplanned family encounters may increase nurse stress without adequate spatial and organizational support.",Rippin Allyn S; Zimring Craig; Samuels Owen; Denham Megan E,HERD,2015.0,9,1,80-98,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26187793/,Comparative Study; Journal Article; Observational Study,,"Critical Care Nursing; Family Nursing; Hospitals, Teaching; Humans; Intensive Care Units; Neuroscience Nursing; Patient-Centered Care; Professional-Family Relations; United States",,,,,,eng,,,,,,,True,"The study involves adult patients in Neuro-ICUs (inclusion criterion), examines family perspectives on nurse-family interactions (focus on psychological impact), and is a qualitative comparative study (valid study type).

The objectives of this study were to determine the impact of neuroscience NPs and PAs and assess demographics of ICUs. All members of the Neurocritical Care Society were asked to complete a survey to obtain their perception regarding the addition of NPs and PAs to the ICU team. Participants rated the abilities of NPs and PAs to provide safe patient care, promote a team environment, anticipate or prevent neurological deterioration, address patient or staff concerns in a timely manner, and communicate effectively on a Likert scale of 1-5. In addition, members were asked to provide basic demographics and background information on the type and size of ICU, type of provider in charge, and role of NPs and PAs in their ICU, including procedures performed, documents written, and number of patients per provider. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected and analyzed. A Mantel-Haenszel chi square and ordinal logistic regression model were used to determine the relationship between the background information and the perception of the abilities of NPs and PAs. The study cohort was composed of 10% of Neurocritical Care Society members. Additional responsibility of NPs and PAs was associated with higher scores in safety, the ability to promote a team environment, address patient or staff concerns, communication, and most importantly, the ability to anticipate or prevent a neurological deterioration (all ps < .0001). Number of NPs and PAs, number of years of employing NP/PAs, number of procedures, and amount of documentation also positively affected safety.

PubMed,PMID/DOI,24481970,Recommendations for the management of cerebral and cerebellar infarction with swelling: a statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association.,"There are uncertainties surrounding the optimal management of patients with brain swelling after an ischemic stroke. Guidelines are needed on how to manage this major complication, how to provide the best comprehensive neurological and medical care, and how to best inform families facing complex decisions on surgical intervention in deteriorating patients. This scientific statement addresses the early approach to the patient with a swollen ischemic stroke in a cerebral or cerebellar hemisphere. The writing group used systematic literature reviews, references to published clinical and epidemiology studies, morbidity and mortality reports, clinical and public health guidelines, authoritative statements, personal files, and expert opinion to summarize existing evidence and to indicate gaps in current knowledge. The panel reviewed the most relevant articles on adults through computerized searches of the medical literature using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science through March 2013. The evidence is organized within the context of the American Heart Association framework and is classified according to the joint American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology Foundation and supplementary American Heart Association Stroke Council methods of classifying the level of certainty and the class and level of evidence. The document underwent extensive American Heart Association internal peer review. Clinical criteria are available for hemispheric (involving the entire middle cerebral artery territory or more) and cerebellar (involving the posterior inferior cerebellar artery or superior cerebellar artery) swelling caused by ischemic infarction. Clinical signs that signify deterioration in swollen supratentorial hemispheric ischemic stroke include new or further impairment of consciousness, cerebral ptosis, and changes in pupillary size. In swollen cerebellar infarction, a decrease in level of consciousness occurs as a result of brainstem compression and therefore may include early loss of corneal reflexes and the development of miosis. Standardized definitions should be established to facilitate multicenter and population-based studies of incidence, prevalence, risk factors, and outcomes. Identification of patients at high risk for brain swelling should include clinical and neuroimaging data. If a full resuscitative status is warranted in a patient with a large territorial stroke, admission to a unit with neurological monitoring capabilities is needed. These patients are best admitted to intensive care or stroke units attended by skilled and experienced physicians such as neurointensivists or vascular neurologists. Complex medical care includes airway management and mechanical ventilation, blood pressure control, fluid management, and glucose and temperature control. In swollen supratentorial hemispheric ischemic stroke, routine intracranial pressure monitoring or cerebrospinal fluid diversion is not indicated, but decompressive craniectomy with dural expansion should be considered in patients who continue to deteriorate neurologically. There is uncertainty about the efficacy of decompressive craniectomy in patients ≥60 years of age. In swollen cerebellar stroke, suboccipital craniectomy with dural expansion should be performed in patients who deteriorate neurologically. Ventriculostomy to relieve obstructive hydrocephalus after a cerebellar infarct should be accompanied by decompressive suboccipital craniectomy to avoid deterioration from upward cerebellar displacement. In swollen hemispheric supratentorial infarcts, outcome can be satisfactory, but one should anticipate that one third of patients will be severely disabled and fully dependent on care even after decompressive craniectomy. Surgery after a cerebellar infarct leads to acceptable functional outcome in most patients. Swollen cerebral and cerebellar infarcts are critical conditions that warrant immediate, specialized neurointensive care and often neurosurgical intervention. Decompressive craniectomy is a necessary option in many patients. Selected patients may benefit greatly from such an approach, and although disabled, they may be functionally independent.",Wijdicks Eelco F M; Sheth Kevin N; Carter Bob S; Greer David M; Kasner Scott E; Kimberly W Taylor; Schwab Stefan; Smith Eric E; Tamargo Rafael J; Wintermark Max,Stroke,2014.0,45,4,1222-38,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24481970/,Journal Article; Practice Guideline,,Adult; American Heart Association; Brain Edema; Cerebellar Diseases; Cerebral Infarction; Critical Care; Humans; Neurology; Neurosurgical Procedures; United States,,,,,,eng,,,,,,,False,"The paper focuses on medical management of cerebral/cerebellar infarction without addressing family perspectives, experiences, or psychological impacts.

PubMed,PMID/DOI,24216520,A miniature optical neuronavigation system for CT-guided stereotaxy.,"Neuronavigation devices have progressed over the past 2 decades, but logistical limitations remain for many stereotactic procedures. We describe our technique and accuracy for a novel miniature optical tracking system which overcomes these limitations. The minioptical tracking system uses a miniature video camera mounted on a rigid cannula to determine cannula location and orientation relative to a patient-attached sticker containing reference markers. A CT scan is used to register these markers to the anatomy and a user-selected target. A computer displays the cannula guidance information to the target. Bench testing was performed on 225 targets in a custom test phantom and additional testing was performed on 20 small targets in an anthropomorphic head phantom to determine the practical accuracy and workflow. The phantom study demonstrated that 3-D navigation accuracy is 1.41 ± 0.53 mm. There was a 100% head phantom study success rate for the 20 small targets. The resulting accuracy data demonstrated good correlation with the CT data, and the clinical simulation workflow indicated its potential usefulness for common neurosurgical applications.

In a matched cohort design, we assessed the relative impact of continuous versus intermittent CSF drainage on intracranial pressure in the management of adult severe TBI. Sixty-two severe TBI patients were assessed. Thirty-one patients managed by open EVD drainage were matched by age, sex, and injury severity (initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score) to 31 patients treated with a closed EVD drainage. Patients in the open EVD group also had a parenchymal intracranial pressure (ICP) monitor placed through an adjacent burr hole, allowing real-time recording of ICP. Hourly ICP and other pertinent data, such as length of stay in intensive care unit (LOS-ICU), Injury Severity Score, and survival status, were extracted from our prospective database. With age, injury severity (initial GCS score), and neurosurgical intervention adjusted for, there was a statistically significant difference of 5.66 mmHg in mean ICP (p < 0.0001) between the open and the closed EVD groups, with the closed EVD group exhibiting greater mean ICP.

The current nature and implications of the role of anesthesiology-based neurointensivist remain unclear. The purpose of this survey was to assess today's practice environment of anesthesiology-based neurointensivists as a framework for future study. During the period between January 2011 and March 2011, we identified anesthesiologists who provide patient care in specialized NeuroICUs in the United States. We used an online, 15-question survey to gauge the environment and their role in the delivery of care to critically ill patients admitted to NeuroICUs. Of the 104 NeuroICUs in the United States, 22 institutions include anesthesiology-based neurointensivists (n=41). With a response from 33 of 41 requested surveys, anesthesiology-based neurointensivists reported that background training and roles for providing patient care in the NeuroICU setting varied widely between institutions.

In these cases, neurologists need to make medical decisions based on advance directives (such as a living will) or the decisions of a surrogate. A hypothetical case of a 60-year-old man with an intracerebral hemorrhage is used to highlight some of the difficulties that can occur when attempting to apply general statements made in a living will to a specific medical treatment decision.

These can adversely affect the outcome and can result in poor survival. Many studies confirm that tracheostomy is a safe, effective method of airway management for patients with severe head, facial and multisystem organ trauma. To know the indications for performing early tracheostomy and its outcome. Retrospective data analysis. The present study is a retrospective analysis of all patients who were admitted with the diagnosis of head injury between January 2007 and December 2009 and underwent tracheostomy at a rural tertiary care trauma center of Central India. During the study period, a total of 40 patients with head injury underwent tracheostomy. All the patients sustained head injury in road traffic accidents. The mean age of the patients was 37.6 years (range 14-75 years, standard deviation 14 ± 14.9 years). Maximum number of patients were in their third decade of life, followed by those in the fifth and fourth decades. There were 36 males and 4 females. Tracheostomy was performed in 30 patients with severe head injury, 9 patients with moderate head injury and in only one case of mild head injury as the patient had multiple facial injuries compromising the airway. Neurocritical care is a relatively new field in India, and the facilities for critical neurosurgical patients are available only in a very few tertiary care centers mainly serving the urban areas.

PubMed,PMID/DOI,20673358,Retrospective agreement and consent to neurocritical care is influenced by functional outcome.,"Only limited data are available on consent and satisfaction of patients receiving specialized neurocritical care. In this study we (i) analyzed the extent of retrospective consent to neurocritical care--given by patients or their relatives--depending on functional outcome one year after hospital stay, and (ii) identified predisposing factors for retrospective agreement to neurocritical care. We investigated 704 consecutive patients admitted to a nonsurgical neurocritical care unit over a period of 2 years (2006 through 2007). Demographic and clinical parameters were analyzed, and the patients were grouped according to their diagnosis. Functional outcome, retrospective consent to neurocritical care, and satisfaction with hospital stay was obtained by mailed standardized questionnaires. Logistic regression analyses were calculated to determine independent predictors for consent. High consent and satisfaction after neurointensive care (91% and 90%, respectively) was observed by those patients who reached an independent life one year after neurointensive care unit (ICU) stay. However, only 19% of surviving patients who were functionally dependent retrospectively agreed to neurocritical care. Unfavorable functional outcome and the diagnosis of stroke were independent predictors for missing retrospective consent. Retrospective agreement to neurocritical care is influenced by functional outcome. Especially in severely affected stroke patients who cannot communicate their preferences regarding life-sustaining therapy, neurocritical care physicians should balance the expected burdens and benefits of treatment to meet the patients' putative wishes. Efforts should be undertaken to identify predictors for severe disability after neurocritical care.",Kiphuth Ines C; Köhrmann Martin; Kuramatsu Joji B; Mauer Christoph; Breuer Lorenz; Schellinger Peter D; Schwab Stefan; Huttner Hagen B,"Critical care (London, England)",2010.0,14,4,R144,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20673358/,Journal Article,,"Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Chi-Square Distribution; Critical Care; Female; Humans; Informed Consent; Intensive Care Units; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Nervous System Diseases; Patient Satisfaction; Retrospective Studies; Statistics, Nonparametric; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult",,,,,,eng,,,,,,,True,"The paper examines retrospective consent to neurocritical care in adult patients (>=18 years) and their relatives, focusing on factors influencing agreement and satisfaction.

PubMed,PMID,17099258,Repeat percutaneous tracheostomy in the neurocritically ill patient.,"Percutaneous tracheostomy is a widely used and accepted method for long-term mechanical ventilation and airway protection. Neurocritically ill patients sometimes require repeat tracheostomy, which is traditionally considered a relative contraindication for percutaneous procedure. The aim of this study was to determine the safety of repeat percutaneous tracheostomy in neurocritically ill patients with a history of previous tracheostomy. In the 16-bed academic neurointensive care unit, we prospectively enrolled patients who needed new tracheostomy placement for airway protection or prolonged mechanical ventilation and had previously undergone percutaneous tracheostomy placement. We collected data on indications, procedure, periprocedural complications, and outcome of repeated tracheostomy. Between January 2001 and October 2005, we enrolled 12 consecutive patients (mean age 35.4 +/- 7.0 years) who underwent repeat percutaneous tracheostomy. Head injury was the most common underlying diagnosis (seven patients, 58%). Tracheostomy tube placement was easy and successful in all patients, and none of the patients needed conversion to surgical tracheostomy. In three patients, ultrasound-guided needle aspiration was used before the procedure to confirm the position of the trachea. No patients died or experienced serious complication related to the procedure. Two patients (17%) had a minor periprocedural bleeding, which was controlled with local compression. Long-term outcome was poor, with only two patients alive and off the ventilator at hospital discharge, both with serious disability. Repeat percutaneous tracheostomy can be performed safely in neurocritically ill patients who have undergone previous tracheostomy.",Yilmaz Murat; Dosemeci Levent; Cengiz Melike; Sanli Suat; Gajic Ognjen; Ramazanoglu Atilla,Neurocritical care,2006.0,5,2,120-3,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17099258/,Journal Article,,"Adult; Critical Care; Female; Humans; Intensive Care Units; Male; Middle Aged; Reoperation; Respiration, Artificial; Retrospective Studies; Tracheostomy; Treatment Outcome",,,,,,eng,,,,,,,False,"The study focuses on clinical outcomes (safety and success of repeat tracheostomy) without addressing family perspectives, psychological impacts, or caregiver experiences.

Here we present the results of a written survey of physicians on neurological intensive care units in Germany regarding the treatment of patients with basilar artery thrombosis and locked-in syndrome. 52% of the 93 physicians who replied advocated not treating severe infections with antibiotics, 38% were in favor of stopping intensive care. In contrast, 55% recommended intubating the patient in the presence of swallowing disturbances and imminent aspiration. 58% were in favor of discussing these problems in detail with the patient, and 87% advocated discussing them with relatives. Nearly all physicians (97%) recommended using adequate amounts of opiates and benzodiazepines. In very rare cases, 99% would agree to the use of passive euthanasia and 19% to active euthanasia.

To address these concerns, CNSs in a tertiary hospital developed a nursing case management model for patients in a medical-surgical-neurological intensive care unit. Long-term relationships between nursing case managers (NCMs), patients, and families grounded the model. The NCM crossed traditional unit boundaries with the patient, improving communication among patient, family, and the healthcare team.

Currently BAEP and SEP are preferentially employed. VEP monitoring is a relatively uncommon procedure, because late evoked potentials tend to be relatively unstable, varying in amplitude to a moderate extend from changes of temperature, drugs, attention and the level of consciousness. A valuable approach of VEP monitoring on intensive care units are structures of the visual system at risk in vascular disease of the vertebrobasilar system or during evaluated intracranial pressure (EIP). This study uses the data of 20 stuporous patients presenting with either intracranial mass lesions or vascular diseases of the vertebrobasilar system and 20 control persons. Light emitting diode (LED)-VEP are compared with checkerboard stimulation in control persons using the technique of cross-correlation. The comparison of the control group with patients using LED-VEP allows definition of limits for normal variation as a base for identification of significant changes.
