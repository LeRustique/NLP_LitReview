A descriptive, exploratory, multiple-case design was used. Participant observation and semistructured interviews were used to capture the experiences of families. Analysis revealed the ""bedside phenomenon,"" which offers insight into families' desire to be at the bedside. The phenomenon is twofold, in that families are motivated by two goals to be at the bedside: They want to ensure their loved one is receiving the best care possible, and they want to maintain a connection with the person. Nurses who understand and recognize this phenomenon may be better positioned to work with families to achieve these goals.",Lam Pikka; Beaulieu Marcia,2004

To address these concerns, CNSs in a tertiary hospital developed a nursing case management model for patients in a medical-surgical-neurological intensive care unit. Long-term relationships between nursing case managers (NCMs), patients, and families grounded the model. The NCM crossed traditional unit boundaries with the patient, improving communication among patient, family, and the healthcare team. Evaluation of the NCM's experience suggested four types of interventions: (a) telling the story, (b) advancing the plan of care, (c) maintaining values and beliefs, and (d) assisting with options and decisions. Case studies illustrate these interventions and demonstrate cost savings.",Sohl-Kreiger R; Lagaard M W; Scherrer J,1996

In this study we (i) analyzed the extent of retrospective consent to neurocritical care--given by patients or their relatives--depending on functional outcome one year after hospital stay, and (ii) identified predisposing factors for retrospective agreement to neurocritical care. We investigated 704 consecutive patients admitted to a nonsurgical neurocritical care unit over a period of 2 years (2006 through 2007). Demographic and clinical parameters were analyzed, and the patients were grouped according to their diagnosis. Functional outcome, retrospective consent to neurocritical care, and satisfaction with hospital stay was obtained by mailed standardized questionnaires. Logistic regression analyses were calculated to determine independent predictors for consent. High consent and satisfaction after neurointensive care (91% and 90%, respectively) was observed by those patients who reached an independent life one year after neurointensive care unit (ICU) stay. However, only 19% of surviving patients who were functionally dependent retrospectively agreed to neurocritical care. Unfavorable functional outcome and the diagnosis of stroke were independent predictors for missing retrospective consent. Retrospective agreement to neurocritical care is influenced by functional outcome. Especially in severely affected stroke patients who cannot communicate their preferences regarding life-sustaining therapy, neurocritical care physicians should balance the expected burdens and benefits of treatment to meet the patients' putative wishes. Efforts should be undertaken to identify predictors for severe disability after neurocritical care.",Kiphuth Ines C; Köhrmann Martin; Kuramatsu Joji B; Mauer Christoph; Breuer Lorenz; Schellinger Peter D; Schwab Stefan; Huttner Hagen B,2010

A growing evidence base suggests that the built environment can facilitate the delivery of patient- and family-centered care (PFCC). However, few studies examine how the PFCC model impacts the delivery of care, specifically the role of design in nurse-family interactions in the adult intensive care unit (ICU) from the perspective of the bedside nurse. Two neuro ICUs with the same patient population and staff, but with different layouts, were compared. Structured observations were conducted to assess changes in the frequency, location, and content of interactions between the two units. Discussions with staff provided additional insights into nurse attitudes, perceptions, and experiences caring for families. Nurses reported challenges balancing the needs of many stakeholders in a complex clinical environment, regardless of unit layout. However, differences in communication patterns between the clinician- and family-centered units were observed. More interactions were observed in nurse workstations in the PFCC unit, with most initiated by family. While the new unit was seen as more conducive to the delivery of PFCC, some nurses reported a loss of workspace control. Patient- and family-centered design created new spatial and temporal opportunities for nurse-family interactions in the adult ICU, thus supporting PFCC goals. However, greater exposure to unplanned family encounters may increase nurse stress without adequate spatial and organizational support.",Rippin Allyn S; Zimring Craig; Samuels Owen; Denham Megan E,2015

The COVID-19 pandemic has further intensified this experience in addition to exacerbating clinician and resident burnout. To ameliorate some of these concerns, a team of resident and medical student trainees implemented a virtual shared medical appointment (vSMA) program for inpatients with acute cerebrovascular disorders and their caregivers. The authors hypothesized that an early intervention in the form of a vSMA improves patient and caregiver health literacy and preparedness while simultaneously educating clinical trainees on effective communication skills and reducing clinician burnout. Patients and caregivers of admitted patients were identified through a census of neurosurgery, neurocritical care, and neurology electronic medical records. A weekly 60-minute secure virtual session consisted of introductions and a 10-minute standardized presentation on cerebrovascular disease management, followed by participant-guided discussion. Participants completed presession and postsession surveys. Through this small feasibility study data were obtained regarding present challenges, both expected and unforeseen. A total of 170 patients were screened, and 13 patients and 26 caregivers participated in at least 1 vSMA session. A total of 6 different healthcare providers facilitated sessions. The vSMA program received overwhelmingly positive feedback from caregivers. Survey responses demonstrated that 96.4% of caregivers and 75% of patients were satisfied with the session, 96.4% of caregivers and 87.5% of patients would recommend this type of appointment to a friend or family member, and 88.8% of providers reported feeling validated by conducting the session. The participant group had a 20% greater percentage of patients discharged home without home needs compared to the nonparticipant group. The primary obstacles encountered included technological frustrations with the consent process and the sessions themselves. Implementation of a vSMA program at a tertiary care center during a pandemic was feasible. Themes caregivers expressed on the postsession survey included better understanding of caring for a stroke patient and coping with the unpredictability of a patient's prognosis. The pandemic has precipitated shifts toward telehealth, but this study highlights the importance of avoiding marginalization of elderly and less technologically inclined populations.",Mahajan Uma V; Sharma Neha; Maynard Marquis; Kang Lei; Labak Collin M; Raghavan Alankrita; Sajatovic Martha; Hoffer Alan; Shammassian Berje H; Wright James M; Zhou Xiaofei; Wright Christina Huang,2022

Therefore, the purpose of the current study was to construct linear growth models to examine whether the personality traits of family members of individuals with severe brain injury could predict the trajectories of their own mental health-related quality of life (HRQoL), anxiety, and depression beginning in a neurointensive care unit through 1 year after injury. Danish family members of individuals with severe brain injury (n = 52) completed the Short Form-36 assessing mental HRQoL (vitality, social functioning, role limitations-emotional, mental health), anxiety, and depression across 5 time points during the 1st year after injury. The measure of personality was administered 3 months after the patients' discharge. All mental HRQoL, anxiety, and depression variables improved significantly over time. Caregivers who were less neurotic and less conscientious had higher vitality, social functioning, and mental health over time, whereas caregivers who were more agreeable had higher social functioning over time. Caregivers with lower neuroticism had lower anxiety and depression over time, as well as a more accelerated decrease in anxiety and depression. Caregivers' personality traits were strongly associated over time with mental HRQoL, anxiety, and depression, with neuroticism being especially important for trajectories of anxiety and depression. These results suggest that personality assessments for caregivers of individuals with severe brain injury could help identify those most at risk for poor mental health over the course of rehabilitation.

The terms post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) and PICS-family (PICS-F) have been used in non-neurocritical care populations to characterize the cognitive, psychiatric, and physical sequelae associated with critical care hospitalization in survivors and their informal caregivers (e.g., family and friends who provide unpaid care). In this review, we first summarize the literature on the cognitive, psychiatric, and physical correlates of PICS and PICS-F in non-neurocritical patient populations and draw attention to their long-term negative health consequences. Next, keeping in mind the distinction between disease-related neurocognitive changes and those that are associated directly with the experience of a critical illness, we review the neuropsychological sequelae among patients with common neurocritical illnesses. We acknowledge the clinical factors contributing to the difficulty in studying PICS in the neurocritical care patient population, provide recommendations for future lines of research, and encourage collaboration among critical care physicians in all specialties to facilitate continuity of care and to help elucidate mechanism(s) of PICS and PICS-F in all critical illness survivors.

Despite advances in endovascular and neurocritical care approaches to stroke treatment and recovery, there remains a considerable unmet need for interventions targeting the emotional impact of stroke for both patients and their informal caregivers. This is important because untreated emotional distress becomes chronic and negatively impacts quality of life in both patients and caregivers. Our team previously used mixed methods to iteratively develop a six-session modular dyadic intervention to prevent chronic emotional distress in patients with stroke and their informal caregivers called ""Recovering Together"" (RT) using feedback from dyads and the medical team. The aim of the current study is to test the feasibility of recruitment, acceptability of screening and randomization methods, acceptability of RT, satisfaction with RT, feasibility of the assessment process at all time points, and acceptability of outcome measures. Secondarily, we aimed to explore within-treatment effect sizes and change in clinically significant symptoms of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress (PTS). The larger goal was to strengthen methodological rigor before a subsequent efficacy trial. We conducted a feasibility randomized controlled trial to evaluate the RT intervention relative to minimally enhanced usual care (MEUC) in stroke patients admitted to a Neurosciences Intensive Care Unit (Neuro-ICU). Dyads were enrolled within 1 week of hospitalization if they met specific eligibility criteria. Assessments were done via paper and pencil at baseline, and electronically via REDCap or over the phone at post-intervention (approximately 6 weeks after baseline), and 3 months later. Assessments included demographics, resiliency intervention targets (mindfulness, coping, self-efficacy, and interpersonal bond), and emotional distress (depression, anxiety, and PTS). Primary outcomes were feasibility and acceptability markers. Secondary outcomes were depression, anxiety, PTS, mindfulness, coping, self-efficacy, and interpersonal bond. We consented 20 dyads, enrolled 17, and retained 16. Although many patients were missed before we could approach them, very few declined to participate or dropped out once study staff made initial contact. Feasibility of enrollment (87% of eligible dyads enrolled), acceptability of screening, and randomization (all RT dyads retained after randomization) were excellent. Program satisfaction (RT post-test M = 11.33/12 for patients M = 12/12 for caregivers), and adherence to treatment sessions (six of seven RT dyads attending 4/6 sessions) were high. There were no technical difficulties that affected the delivery of the intervention. There was minimal missing data. For both patients and caregivers, participation in RT was generally associated with clinically significant improvement in emotional distress symptoms from baseline to post-test. Participation in MEUC was associated with clinically significant worsening in emotional distress. Although some of the improvement in emotional distress symptoms decreased in the RT group between post-test to 3 months, these changes were not clinically significant. RT was also associated with substantial decrease in frequency of individuals who met criteria for clinically significant symptoms, while the opposite was true for MEUC.

Our primary objective was to determine if early integration of palliative care consultations within this cohort was feasible and would impact understanding, decision-making and emotional support to patients and their surrogate decision makers. Our secondary objective was to evaluate the long-term impact of early palliative care assessment on the development of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This was a single center prospective pilot study. Patients with moderate-to-severe ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes were randomized into two arms. The control arm received standard intensive care and the intervention arm received an additional early palliative care consultation within 72 hours of hospitalization. Study assessments with the participants were obtained on day 1-3, and day 5-7 of care with comparisons of total scores on the Questionnaire on Communication (QOC), Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Furthermore, comparisons of HADS and PTSD DSM-5 (PCL- 5) scores were completed at 3 months. Linear mixed effects models were conducted to examine the association between intervention and participant's scores. A total of 22 participants were enrolled between February 2019 and April 2020. Statistically significant improvement in scores was seen in the total HADS score (p=0.043) and PCL5 score (p=0.033) at 3 months following intervention. Collaboration between the intensive care and palliative care team with early palliative assessment may be beneficial in lowering anxiety, depression and PTSD symptoms in critically ill stroke patients and their caregivers.

To inform future interventions to mitigate this distress, we characterized the stressors and coping strategies of caregivers of patients with SABI with varying levels of emotional distress during the acute and postacute stages of treatment. We conducted semistructured interviews with family caregivers of patients with SABI around the time of neurological intensive care unit discharge (T1) and at 2-month follow-up (T2). All caregivers included in this current study completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale at T1 and/or T2. We then stratified transcripts by caregiver distress level, characterizing caregivers who scored > 11 on at least one Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale subscale as ""high distress"" and ≤ 11 as ""low distress."" We conducted deductive, conceptual content analysis to compare perceived stressors and coping strategies employed at both time points. Caregivers in both strata reported many similar stressors at each time point, including ongoing uncertainty. However, there were also differences in stressors by level of distress and time point of assessment. At T1, high-distress caregivers reported pronounced stress related to navigating the health care system and communicating with providers, staff, and the patient. At T2, high-distress caregivers noted heightened difficulty with transitioning to long-term caregiving, co-occurring complex emotions, and communication with family and friends. Conversely, low-distress caregivers focused on challenges with team-based medical decision making at T2. Clear differences in coping strategies also emerged, such that high-distress caregivers relied primarily on avoidance at both points, whereas low-distress caregivers incorporated more problem-solving and self-care strategies. Psychosocial interventions for caregivers of patients with SABI are needed to reduce emotional distress. Skills should be applied to relevant topics based on time since neurological intensive care unit discharge and distress level. Skills should focus on reducing avoidance, promoting active coping, and targeting the perceived stressors specific to high-distress versus low-distress caregivers revealed here.",Meurer Katherine J; Presciutti Alexander M; Bannon Sarah M; Kubota Rina; Baskaran Nithyashri; Kim Jisoo; Zhang Qiang; Reichman Mira; Fishbein Nathan S; Lichstein Kaitlyn; Motta Melissa; Muehlschlegel Susanne; Reznik Michael E; Jaffa Matthew N; Creutzfeldt Claire J; Fehnel Corey R; Tomlinson Amanda D; Williamson Craig A; Vranceanu Ana-Maria; Hwang David Y,2025

As intensive care unit (ICU) survival continues to improve, PICS is becoming increasingly recognized as a public health problem. Studies that focus on PICS have typically excluded patients with acute brain injuries and chronic neurodegenerative problems. However, patients who require neurocritical care undoubtedly suffer from impairments that overlap substantially with those encompassed by PICS. A major challenge is to distinguish between impairments related to brain injury and those that occur as a consequence of critical care. The general principles for the prevention and management of PICS and multidomain impairments in patients with moderate and severe neurological injuries are similar including the ICU liberation bundle, multidisciplinary team-based care throughout the continuum of care, and increasing awareness regarding the challenges of critical care survivorship among patients, families, and multidisciplinary team members. An extension of this concept, PICS-Family (PICS-F) refers to the mental health consequences of the intensive care experience for families and loved ones of ICU survivors.

However, the integration of palliative care within neurocritical care settings has been relatively understudied. This descriptive study aims to identify the characteristics, palliative care needs, and outcomes of patients referred to palliative care services during admission to the neurosurgical intensive care unit (NS-ICU). A retrospective analysis of adults admitted to the NS-ICU at a referral hospital between December 2019 and December 2021 was conducted. The study focused on those referred to the inpatient palliative care team with diagnoses of non-traumatic brain hemorrhage, traumatic brain injury, or brain neoplasm. Excluded were patients who died before palliative care consultation or lacked sufficient information. The investigation assessed demographic and clinical characteristics at consultation, along with post-consultation hospital outcomes derived from medical records and interview notes. In this study involving 38 enrolled patients, the median age was 65, with 42.1% females. The most prevalent diagnosis was nontraumatic brain hemorrhage (47.4%). Reasons for palliative care consultation included psychosocial support (95%), goal-of-care discussions (68%), decision-making support (50%), and communication facilitation (39%). The median time from NS-ICU admission to consultation was 3.5 days (interquartile range, 1-8 days), and all interviews involved family members. Key decision topics encompassed mechanical ventilation (23.7%) and tracheostomy (21.1%). Patient preferences for life-sustaining treatment could be estimated in only 47.4% of cases, often resulting in treatment disagreement. Among the 38 patients, 26 (68.4%) died during admission. Before the consultation, full code status, partial code status, and comfort care alone were reported as 32%, 66%, and 2%, respectively; post-consultation, these figures shifted to 11%, 42%, and 47%, respectively. Palliative care was predominantly sought for psychosocial support and discussions concerning goals of care. Despite challenges in ascertaining patient treatment preferences, palliative care consultations proved invaluable in aiding family members and facilitating treatment decision-making.

Often, the stressed and anxious family is not involved in the care process until the rehabilitation phase. This study aimed to evaluate the integration of family involvement in the neuro-intensive care of TBI patients on family satisfaction. Materials and methods This pre-test-post-test quasi-experimental study involved 70 families of moderate and severe TBI patients, divided equally into experimental and control groups. A guideline, Family Involvement in the Care of TBI (FIC-TBI), was developed. The key elements of this guideline were structured communication, participation in basic care, and shared decision-making. FIC-TBI was integrated into the critical care management of TBI. The impact of FIC-TBI was evaluated using the Family Satisfaction in the ICU Care Unit 24R (FS-ICU 24R) tool. Results Data analysis was done through paired and unpaired t-tests as well as analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). The results showed statistically significant differences in the post-test family satisfaction scores between the experimental and control groups. The adjusted mean satisfaction scores of components such as satisfaction with care (F(1, N-2)=984.63; p<0.001), satisfaction with decision-making (F(1, N-2)=1489.63; p<0.001), and overall satisfaction (F(1, N-2)=712.87; p<0.001) were higher in the experimental group. The study found a significant correlation between family satisfaction levels and variables such as gender and education. Conclusions This study was done with the objective to evaluate the impact of integration of family involvement into the neuro-intensive care of TBI on family satisfaction. The findings demonstrated that the FIC-TBI guideline improved satisfaction across multiple dimensions, such as care, communication, decision-making, and overall experience. The study also found a significant correlation between family satisfaction and gender and education.

Up to one-half of all ICU survivors suffer from new or worsening impairments in physical, cognitive, and psychological domains of health that are often not realized until they attempt to re-enter their previous lives. These devastating long-term sequelae of critical illness, collectively described as post-intensive care syndrome (PICS), can carry enormous consequences for an ICU survivor's ability to care for their family, return to work, and regain their previous quality of life for months to years after their inciting illness. Despite mounting research on PICS and survivorship, a knowledge gap exists whereby ICU team members may not always be aware of PICS and may not counsel their patients on the challenges awaiting them after discharge. Understanding how best to communicate these challenges to patients and families is crucial in preparing for survivorship beyond the ICU. In this review, we summarize PICS and possible recovery trajectories of ICU survivors. We then discuss communication strategies, emphasizing the role of empathy. Finally, we provide a suggested framework to handle these crucial conversations.

In this article, we describe three different roles that EM clinicians can fill as they initiate the provision of primary neuropalliative care to neurocritically ill patients: the stage setter, the spokesperson, and the screener. As the stage setter, EM clinicians start to build trust with the family by “breaking bad news”; encouraging them to consider the patient’s values, preferences, functional baseline, and directives; and providing support to the family during this emotional time as they hand them over to the admitting team who will continue this conversation. As the spokesperson, EM clinicians are involved in early treatment decisions, including whether the patient is admitted to the acute care service or the intensive care unit or transferred to a tertiary care facility, with the goal of preventing both the overuse and underuse of life-sustaining treatment. Lastly, as the screener, EM clinicians have a role to ensure that patients with chronic neurological diseases and patients with a medical history that puts them at high-risk of developing a neurological emergency have goals-of-care conversations and have acceptable control of their daily symptom burden.

Malnutrition problems are very common after a stroke. Several clinical studies have shown the contribution of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) feeding after stroke in terms of improving nutritional status and reducing mortality. The aim of this study is to compare the burden and depression among caregivers of ischemic stroke patients fed with PEG and orally.
Methods
A total of 63 caregivers of patients with acute ischemic stroke who were followed up in the neurointensive care unit with modified Rankin Scale 4 or 5 were recruited in this cross-sectional survey. Clinical data of patients and demographical profile as age, gender, kinship to patient, income, and level of education of caregivers were recorded. On their 3rd-month follow-up visit, Beck Depression Inventory and The Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) were administered to caregivers to evaluate depressive symptoms and caregiver burden. A semi-structured questionnairre was developed and conducted by the researchers with the caregivers to assess their thoughts of nutrition.
Results
Thirty-two caregivers of stroke patients on PEG and 31 caregivers of stroke patients who were fed orally were evaluated. The groups did not differ statistically in terms of demographic variables and depression scores (p > 0.05). However, the mean score of ZBI was significantly higher in the group of caregivers of stroke patients who were fed orally (p = 0.00). Caregivers of stroke patients on PEG had higher scores of caregivers’ thoughts of nutrition support therapy questionnairre (p = 0.00).
Conclusions
Our findings demonstrate that caregivers of stroke patients report lower burden and higher level of positive thinking with PEG feeding than oral feeding. This suggests that nutritional care could include convenient and practicable methods for caregivers of patients with stroke in order to meet patients’ nutritional requirements.",Ertem Devrimsel Harika; Ilik Faik,2019

Anxiety is common in patients experiencing neurocritical illness and their family caregivers. Resilience factors like mindfulness and coping skills may be protective against symptoms of emotional distress, including anxiety. Less is known about the interplay of anxiety symptoms and resilience factors between patients and caregivers. The purpose of this study is to examine the trajectory of anxiety symptoms among dyads of neurocritical care patients without major cognitive impairment and their family caregivers and to elucidate the relationship between resiliency (e.g., mindfulness and coping) and anxiety in these dyads.

Methods:
Prospective, longitudinal study of adults admitted to the neurological intensive care unit (Neuro-ICU) and their caregivers. Dyads of patients (N = 102) and family caregivers (N = 103) completed self-report measures of mindfulness (Cognitive Affective Mindfulness Scale-Revised) and coping (Measure of Current Status-Part A) during Neuro-ICU hospitalization and anxiety symptoms (anxiety subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) during hospitalization and at 3- and 6-month follow-up. We used actor–partner interdependence modeling to predict the effect of one’s own baseline characteristics on one’s own and one’s partner’s future anxiety symptoms.

Results:
Rates of clinically significant anxiety symptoms were 40% for patients and 42% for caregivers at baseline. Of these, 20% of patients and 23% of caregivers showed moderate and severe symptoms. Approximately, one-third of patients and caregivers reported clinically significant anxiety symptoms at 3- and 6-month follow-ups, with more than 20% endorsing moderate or severe symptoms. Patients’ own baseline mindfulness, coping, and anxiety symptoms were associated with lower anxiety symptoms at all time points (ps < 0.001)—this was also true for caregivers. For both patients and caregivers, one’s own baseline mindfulness predicted their partner’s anxiety symptoms 3 months later (p = 0.008), but not at 6-month follow-up.

Conclusions:
Anxiety symptoms in Neuro-ICU patient–caregiver dyads are high through 6 months following admission. Mindfulness is interdependent and protective against anxiety in dyads at 3-month but not 6-month follow-up. Early, dyad-based interventions may prevent the development of chronic anxiety in patients without major cognitive impairment and caregivers.",Meyers Emma E.; Presciutti Alex; Shaffer Kelly M.; Gates Melissa; Lin Ann; Rosand Jonathan; Vranceanu Ana-Maria,2020

There is a critical need to improve support for families making difficult shared decisions about patient care with clinicians in the neuroscience ICU (neuro-ICU). The aim of this study is to identify patient- and family-related factors associated with dissatisfaction with shared decision-making support among families of neuro-critically ill patients.

Methods
We conducted a retrospective observational cohort study using survey data that had been collected from a consecutive sample of family members of patients in the neuro-ICU (one family member per patient) at two US academic centers. Satisfaction with shared decision-making support on ICU discharge had been measured among family members using one specific Likert scale item on the Family Satisfaction in the ICU 24 survey, a validated survey instrument for families of patients in the ICU. We dichotomized top-box responses for this particular item as an outcome variable and identified available patient- and family-related covariates associated with dissatisfaction (i.e., less than complete satisfaction) via univariate and multivariate analyses.

Results
Among 355 surveys, 180 (49.5%) of the surveys indicated dissatisfaction with support during decision-making. In a multivariate model, no preexisting characteristics of families or patients ascertainable on ICU admission were predictive of dissatisfaction. However, among family factors determined during the ICU course, experiencing three or fewer formal family meetings (odds ratio 1.93 [confidence interval 1.13–3.31]; p = 0.01) was significantly predictive of dissatisfaction with decisional support in this cohort with an average patient length of stay of 8.6 days (SD 8.4). There was also a trend toward a family’s decision to keep a patient as full code, without treatment limitations, being predictive of dissatisfaction (odds ratio 1.80 [confidence interval 0.93–3.51]; p = 0.08).

Conclusions
Family dissatisfaction with neuro-ICU shared decision-making support is not necessarily predicted by any preexisting family or patient variables but appears to correlate with participating in fewer formal family meetings during ICU admission. Future studies to improve family satisfaction with neurocritical care decision-making support should have broad inclusion criteria for participants and should consider promoting frequency of family meetings as a core strategy.

To pilot test the feasibility of assessing severity of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, as well as specific lower-order PTSD symptoms, experienced during neuro-ICU admission and their relationship with 3-month QoL scores in multiple domains (i.e. physical, psychological, social and environmental) in both patients and caregivers.

Methods:
Between 2015–16 we enrolled neurologically intact patients and informal caregivers of patients who reported demographics and PTSD symptoms (PTSD-Checklist Specific; PCL-S) during neuro-ICU admission and completed a QoL assessment (World Health Organization Quality of Life – BREF) 3 months later. Clinical data was extracted from medical records. We ran two bivariate correlation matrices amongst PTSD symptom dimensions in patients and caregivers. Then, we used multiple linear regression to examine the prospective association of total PCL-S scores with each QoL domain in both patients and caregivers after adjusting for clinically important variables. Next, we explored differential associations between the 4 PTSD symptom dimensions and each QoL domain in both patients and caregivers, adjusting for sex and age.

Results:
A total of 70 patients (45.7% women, 84.3% white, mean age 52.08 years) and 64 caregivers (64.1% women, 90.6% white, mean age 53.12 years) were included. PTSD symptom dimensions were moderately-strongly correlated amongst patients (r = .65–.79, p < .001) and caregivers (r = .55–.78, p < .001). For both patients and caregivers, greater PTSD symptom severity was prospectively associated with lower QoL in all domains (β = −.289 to −.622; p < .05). Our exploratory analysis revealed that greater numbing symptoms were associated with lower psychological QoL in patients (β: −.397, p = .038), and lower physical (β: −.409, p=.014), psychological (β: −.519, p =.001), and social QoL (β: −.704, p < .001) in caregivers. Greater re-experiencing symptoms was associated with lower physical QoL in both patients (β: −.422, p = .047) and caregivers (β: −.4, p=.041).

Conclusions:
Our preliminary results indicated that greater severity of PTSD symptoms, and specifically numbing and re-experiencing symptoms, experienced by patients and caregivers during neuro-ICU admission were predictive of worse 3-month QoL.

Admission to a neurological intensive care unit (Neuro-ICU) can increase risk for depressive and anxiety symptoms for both patients and caregivers. To better understand the long-term mental health impact of a Neuro-ICU admission, we examined the dyadic interdependence between depression and anxiety at Neuro-ICU admission with 3-month quality of life (QoL) for patients and caregivers in a longitudinal, observational cohort study.

Method
We assessed depressive and anxiety symptoms (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; HADS) reported by neurologically intact patients (n = 72) and their caregivers (n = 72) within 2 weeks of Neuro-ICU admission (baseline) and 3-months post-discharge (follow-up). We examined the longitudinal association between dyadic depression and anxiety at Neuro-ICU admission and 3-month QoL (World Health Organization; QOL-BREF) across four domains (Physical, Psychological, Social relationships, and Environmental QoL) in separate actor-partner interdependence models (APIM) for patients and caregivers.

Results
In the overall models, patients’ own baseline depression levels were negatively associated with their own 3-month QoL in all domains (β = − 0.53 to − 0.64, p < 0.001), and for caregivers, only in the psychological (β = − 0.73, p < .001) and social relationships (β = − 0.56, p < .001) domains. No actor effects were found for one’s own baseline anxiety impacting one’s own 3-month QoL. Partner effects for one’s own depression were significant for caregivers on patients’ 3-month psychological (β = − 0.26, p < .02) and environmental (β = − 0.29, p < .03) QoL, as well as for patients on caregiver’s 3-month psychological QoL (β = 0.25, p < .02). No partner effects were significant in association with baseline anxiety and 3-month QoL in both patients and caregivers.

Conclusion
Neuro-ICU patients’ and caregivers’ baseline depression has significant negative impacts on their own long-term QoL. Caregivers demonstrate significant negative impacts on patient long-term QoL in domains related to emotional distress and caregiver burden. Early identification of mental health symptoms, especially depression, during Neuro-ICU admission may provide an intervention opportunity to improve QoL post-discharge for both dyad members.",Quinn Patricia A.; Mace Ryan A.; Presciutti Alex; Vranceanu Ana-Maria,2024

A qualitative assessment of discharge resource needs is important for developing evidence-based care improvements in neurocritically ill patients. We hypothesized that standardized, open-ended assessments of patients or caregivers after neurocritical care would result in themes that reflect post-intensive care concerns.

METHODS:
We conducted a quality improvement initiative at an academic hospital and included all patients admitted to the Neurosciences Intensive Care Unit (NSICU) over an 18-month period. Telephone assessments were made at 3–6 months following admission. Patients or caregivers were asked if they had adequate resources upon discharge and if they had any unanswered questions. The content of responses was reviewed by a neurointensivist and neurocritical care nurse practitioner. A structured codebook was developed, organized into themes, and applied to the responses.

RESULTS:
61 patients or caregivers responded regarding access to resources at discharge with 114 individual codable responses. Responses centered around five themes with 23 unique codes: satisfied, needs improvement, dissatisfied, poor post ICU care, and poor health. The most frequently coded responses were that caregivers believed their loved one had experienced an unclear discharge (n=11) or premature discharge (n=12). 204 patients or caregivers responded regarding unanswered questions or additional comments at follow-up, with 516 codable responses. These centered around six themes with 26 unique codes: positive experience, negative experience, neutral experience, medical questions, ongoing medical care or concern, or remembrance of time spent in the ICU. The most frequent response was that caregivers or patients stated that they received good care (n= 115). Multiple concerns were brought up, including lack of follow-up after hospitalization (n=15), and dissatisfaction with post-ICU care (n=15).

CONCLUSIONS:
Obtaining qualitative responses after discharge provided insight into the transition from critical care. This could form the basis for an intervention to provide a smoother transition from the ICU to the outpatient setting.",Rath Kelly; Kreitzer Natalie; Schlichter Erika; Lopez Omar; Ferioli Simona; Ngwenya Laura B.; Foreman Brandon,2020
